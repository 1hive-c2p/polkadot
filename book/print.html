<p>This document aims to describe the purpose, functionality, and implementation of the host for Polkadot's <em>parachains</em> functionality - that is, the software which provides security and advancement for constituent parachains. It is not for the implementer of a specific parachain but rather for the implementer of the Parachain Host. In practice, this is for the implementers of Polkadot in general.</p>
<p>There are a number of other documents describing the research in more detail. All referenced documents will be linked here and should be read alongside this document for the best understanding of the full picture. However, this is the only document which aims to describe key aspects of Polkadot's particular instantiation of much of that research down to low-level technical details and software architecture.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="whence-parachains"><a class="header" href="#whence-parachains">Whence Parachains</a></h1>
<p>Parachains are the solution to a problem. As with any solution, it cannot be understood without first understanding the problem. So let's start by going over the issues faced by blockchain technology that led to us beginning to explore the design space for something like parachains.</p>
<h2 id="issue-1-scalability"><a class="header" href="#issue-1-scalability">Issue 1: Scalability</a></h2>
<p>It became clear a few years ago that the transaction throughput of simple Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and myriad others was simply too low.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: what if there were more blockchains, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems can accomplish higher throughput than PoW blockchains. PoS systems are secured by bonded capital as opposed to spent effort - liquidity opportunity cost vs. burning electricity. The way they work is by selecting a set of validators with known economic identity who lock up tokens in exchange for earning the right to &quot;validate&quot; or participate in the consensus process. If they are found to carry out that process wrongly, they will be slashed, meaning some or all of the locked tokens will be burned. This provides a strong disincentive in the direction of misbehavior.</p>
<p>Since the consensus protocol doesn't revolve around wasting effort, block times and agreement can occur much faster. Solutions to PoW challenges don't have to be found before a block can be authored, so the overhead of authoring a block is reduced to only the costs of creating and distributing the block.</p>
<p>However, consensus on a PoS chain requires full agreement of 2/3+ of the validator set for everything that occurs at Layer 1: all logic which is carried out as part of the blockchain's state machine. This means that everybody still needs to check everything. Furthermore, validators may have different views of the system based on the information that they receive over an asynchronous network, making agreement on the latest state more difficult.</p>
<p>Parachains are an example of a <strong>sharded</strong> protocol. Sharding is a concept borrowed from traditional database architecture. Rather than requiring every participant to check every transaction, we require each participant to check some subset of transactions, with enough redundancy baked in that byzantine (arbitrarily malicious) participants can't sneak in invalid transactions - at least not without being detected and getting slashed, with those transactions reverted.</p>
<p>Sharding and Proof-of-Stake in coordination with each other allow a parachain host to provide full security on many parachains, even without all participants checking all state transitions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: note about network effects &amp; bridging</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="issue-2-flexibility--specialization"><a class="header" href="#issue-2-flexibility--specialization">Issue 2: Flexibility / Specialization</a></h2>
<p>&quot;dumb&quot; VMs don't give you the flexibility. Any engineer knows that being able to specialize on a problem gives them and their users more <em>leverage</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: expand on leverage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having recognized these issues, we set out to find a solution to these problems, which could allow developers to create and deploy purpose-built blockchains unified under a common source of security, with the capability of message-passing between them; a <em>heterogeneous sharding solution</em>, which we have come to know as <strong>Parachains</strong>.</p>

<p>This section aims to describe, at a high level, the actors and protocols involved in running parachains in Polkadot. Specifically, we describe how different actors communicate with each other, what data structures they keep both individually and collectively, and the high-level purpose on why they do these things.</p>
<p>Our top-level goal is to carry a parachain block from authoring to secure inclusion, and define a process which can be carried out repeatedly and in parallel for many different parachains to extend them over time. Understanding of the high-level approach taken here is important to provide context for the proposed architecture further on. The key parts of Polkadot relevant to this are the main Polkadot blockchain, known as the relay-chain, and the actors which provide security and inputs to this blockchain.</p>
<p>First, it's important to go over the main actors we have involved in this protocol.</p>
<ol>
<li>Validators. These nodes are responsible for validating proposed parachain blocks. They do so by checking a Proof-of-Validity (PoV) of the block and ensuring that the PoV remains available. They put financial capital down as &quot;skin in the game&quot; which can be slashed (destroyed) if they are proven to have misvalidated.</li>
<li>Collators. These nodes are responsible for creating the Proofs-of-Validity that validators know how to check. Creating a PoV typically requires familiarity with the transaction format and block authoring rules of the parachain, as well as having access to the full state of the parachain.</li>
<li>Fishermen. These are user-operated, permissionless nodes whose goal is to catch misbehaving validators in exchange for a bounty. Collators and validators can behave as Fishermen too. Fishermen aren't necessary for security, and aren't covered in-depth by this document.</li>
</ol>
<p>This implies a simple pipeline where collators send validators parachain blocks and their requisite PoV to check. Then, validators validate the block using the PoV, signing statements which describe either the positive or negative outcome, and with enough positive statements, the block can be noted on the relay-chain. Negative statements are not a veto but will lead to a dispute, with those on the wrong side being slashed. If another validator later detects that a validator or group of validators incorrectly signed a statement claiming a block was valid, then those validators will be <em>slashed</em>, with the checker receiving a bounty.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem with this formulation. In order for another validator to check the previous group of validators' work after the fact, the PoV must remain <em>available</em> so the other validator can fetch it in order to check the work. The PoVs are expected to be too large to include in the blockchain directly, so we require an alternate <em>data availability</em> scheme which requires validators to prove that the inputs to their work will remain available, and so their work can be checked. Empirical tests tell us that many PoVs may be between 1 and 10MB during periods of heavy load.</p>
<p>Here is a description of the Inclusion Pipeline: the path a parachain block (or parablock, for short) takes from creation to inclusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Validators are selected and assigned to parachains by the Validator Assignment routine.</li>
<li>A collator produces the parachain block, which is known as a parachain candidate or candidate, along with a PoV for the candidate.</li>
<li>The collator forwards the candidate and PoV to validators assigned to the same parachain via the <a href="node/collators/collator-protocol.html">Collator Protocol</a>.</li>
<li>The validators assigned to a parachain at a given point in time participate in the <a href="node/backing/candidate-backing.html">Candidate Backing subsystem</a> to validate candidates that were put forward for validation. Candidates which gather enough signed validity statements from validators are considered &quot;backable&quot;. Their backing is the set of signed validity statements.</li>
<li>A relay-chain block author, selected by BABE, can note up to one (1) backable candidate for each parachain to include in the relay-chain block alongside its backing. A backable candidate once included in the relay-chain is considered backed in that fork of the relay-chain.</li>
<li>Once backed in the relay-chain, the parachain candidate is considered to be &quot;pending availability&quot;. It is not considered to be included as part of the parachain until it is proven available.</li>
<li>In the following relay-chain blocks, validators will participate in the <a href="node/availability/availability-distribution.html">Availability Distribution subsystem</a> to ensure availability of the candidate. Information regarding the availability of the candidate will be noted in the subsequent relay-chain blocks.</li>
<li>Once the relay-chain state machine has enough information to consider the candidate's PoV as being available, the candidate is considered to be part of the parachain and is graduated to being a full parachain block, or parablock for short.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the candidate can fail to be included in any of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The collator is not able to propagate the candidate to any validators assigned to the parachain.</li>
<li>The candidate is not backed by validators participating in the Candidate Backing Subsystem.</li>
<li>The candidate is not selected by a relay-chain block author to be included in the relay chain</li>
<li>The candidate's PoV is not considered as available within a timeout and is discarded from the relay chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>This process can be divided further down. Steps 2 &amp; 3 relate to the work of the collator in collating and distributing the candidate to validators via the Collation Distribution Subsystem. Steps 3 &amp; 4 relate to the work of the validators in the Candidate Backing Subsystem and the block author (itself a validator) to include the block into the relay chain. Steps 6, 7, and 8 correspond to the logic of the relay-chain state-machine (otherwise known as the Runtime) used to fully incorporate the block into the chain. Step 7 requires further work on the validators' parts to participate in the Availability Distribution Subsystem and include that information into the relay chain for step 8 to be fully realized.</p>
<p>This brings us to the second part of the process. Once a parablock is considered available and part of the parachain, it is still &quot;pending approval&quot;. At this stage in the pipeline, the parablock has been backed by a majority of validators in the group assigned to that parachain, and its data has been guaranteed available by the set of validators as a whole. Once it's considered available, the host will even begin to accept children of that block. At this point, we can consider the parablock as having been tentatively included in the parachain, although more confirmations are desired. However, the validators in the parachain-group (known as the &quot;Parachain Validators&quot; for that parachain) are sampled from a validator set which contains some proportion of byzantine, or arbitrarily malicious members. This implies that the Parachain Validators for some parachain may be majority-dishonest, which means that (secondary) approval checks must be done on the block before it can be considered approved. This is necessary only because the Parachain Validators for a given parachain are sampled from an overall validator set which is assumed to be up to &lt;1/3 dishonest - meaning that there is a chance to randomly sample Parachain Validators for a parachain that are majority or fully dishonest and can back a candidate wrongly. The Approval Process allows us to detect such misbehavior after-the-fact without allocating more Parachain Validators and reducing the throughput of the system. A parablock's failure to pass the approval process will invalidate the block as well as all of its descendants. However, only the validators who backed the block in question will be slashed, not the validators who backed the descendants.</p>
<p>The Approval Process, at a glance, looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parablocks that have been included by the Inclusion Pipeline are pending approval for a time-window known as the secondary checking window.</li>
<li>During the secondary-checking window, validators randomly self-select to perform secondary checks on the parablock.</li>
<li>These validators, known in this context as secondary checkers, acquire the parablock and its PoV, and re-run the validation function.</li>
<li>The secondary checkers gossip the result of their checks. Contradictory results lead to escalation, where all validators are required to check the block. The validators on the losing side of the dispute are slashed.</li>
<li>At the end of the Approval Process, the parablock is either Approved or it is rejected. More on the rejection process later.</li>
</ol>
<p>More information on the Approval Process can be found in the dedicated section on <a href="protocol-approval.html">Approval</a>. More information on Disputes can be found in the dedicated section on <a href="protocol-disputes.html">Disputes</a>.</p>
<p>These two pipelines sum up the sequence of events necessary to extend and acquire full security on a Parablock. Note that the Inclusion Pipeline must conclude for a specific parachain before a new block can be accepted on that parachain. After inclusion, the Approval Process kicks off, and can be running for many parachain blocks at once.</p>
<p>Reiterating the lifecycle of a candidate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Candidate: put forward by a collator to a validator.</li>
<li>Seconded: put forward by a validator to other validators</li>
<li>Backable: validity attested to by a majority of assigned validators</li>
<li>Backed: Backable &amp; noted in a fork of the relay-chain.</li>
<li>Pending availability: Backed but not yet considered available.</li>
<li>Included: Backed and considered available.</li>
<li>Accepted: Backed, available, and undisputed</li>
</ol>

<p>The diagram above shows the happy path of a block from (1) Candidate to the (7) Approved state.</p>
<p>It is also important to take note of the fact that the relay-chain is extended by BABE, which is a forkful algorithm. That means that different block authors can be chosen at the same time, and may not be building on the same block parent. Furthermore, the set of validators is not fixed, nor is the set of parachains. And even with the same set of validators and parachains, the validators' assignments to parachains is flexible. This means that the architecture proposed in the next chapters must deal with the variability and multiplicity of the network state.</p>

<p>In this example, group 1 has received block C while the others have not due to network asynchrony. Now, a validator from group 2 may be able to build another block on top of B, called <code>C'</code>. Assume that afterwards, some validators become aware of both C and <code>C'</code>, while others remain only aware of one.</p>

<p>Those validators that are aware of many competing heads must be aware of the work happening on each one. They may contribute to some or a full extent on both. It is possible that due to network asynchrony two forks may grow in parallel for some time, although in the absence of an adversarial network this is unlikely in the case where there are validators who are aware of both chain heads.</p>
<footer id="last-change">Last change: %cs, commit: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/commit/4ddf0ffe5b">4ddf0ffe5b</a></footer><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="approval-process"><a class="header" href="#approval-process">Approval Process</a></h1>
<p>The Approval Process is the mechanism by which the relay-chain ensures that only valid parablocks are finalized and that backing validators are held accountable for managing to get bad blocks included into the relay chain.</p>
<p>Having a parachain include a bad block into a fork of the relay-chain is not catastrophic as long as the block isn't finalized by the relay-chain's finality gadget, GRANDPA. If the block isn't finalized, that means that the fork of the relay-chain can be reverted in favor of another by means of a dynamic fork-choice rule which leads honest validators to ignore any forks containing that parablock.</p>
<p>Dealing with a bad parablock proceeds in these stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detection</li>
<li>Escalation</li>
<li>Consequences</li>
</ol>
<p>First, the bad block must be detected by an honest party. Second, the honest party must escalate the bad block to be checked by all validators. And last, the correct consequences of a bad block must occur. The first consequence, as mentioned above, is to revert the chain so what full nodes perceive to be best no longer contains the bad parablock. The second consequence is to slash all malicious validators. Note that, if the chain containing the bad block is reverted, that the result of the dispute needs to be transplanted or at least transplantable to all other forks of the chain so that malicious validators are slashed in all possible histories. Phrased alternatively, there needs to be no possible relay-chain in which malicious validators get away cost-free.</p>
<p>Accepting a parablock is the end result of having passed through the detection stage without dispute, or having passed through the escalation/dispute stage with a positive outcome. For this to work, we need the detection procedure to have the properties that enough honest validators are always selected to check the parablock and that they cannot be interfered with by an adversary. This needs to be balanced with the scaling concern of parachains in general: the easiest way to get the first property is to have everyone check everything, but that is clearly too heavy. So we also have a desired constraint on the other property that we have as few validators as possible check any particular parablock. Our assignment function is the method by which we select validators to do approval checks on parablocks.</p>
<p>It often makes more sense to think of relay-chain blocks as having been approved or not as opposed to thinking about whether parablocks have been approved. A relay-chain block containing a single bad parablock needs to be reverted, and a relay-chain block that contains only approved parablocks can be called approved, as long as its parent relay-chain block is also approved. It is important that the validity of any particular relay-chain block depend on the validity of its ancestry, so we do not finalize a block which has a bad block in its ancestry.</p>

<p>Approval has roughly two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Assignments</strong> determines which validators performs approval checks on which candidates.  It ensures that each candidate receives enough random checkers, while reducing adversaries' odds for obtaining enough checkers, and limiting adversaries' foreknowledge.  It tracks approval votes to identify when &quot;no show&quot; approval check takes suspiciously long, perhaps indicating the node being under attack, and assigns more checks in this case.  It tracks relay chain equivocations to determine when adversaries possibly gained foreknowledge about assignments, and adds additional checks in this case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Approval checks</strong> listens to the assignments subsystem for outgoing assignment notices that we shall check specific candidates.  It then performs these checks by first invoking the reconstruction subsystem to obtain the candidate, second invoking the candidate validity utility subsystem upon the candidate, and finally sending out an approval vote, or perhaps initiating a dispute.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These both run first as off-chain consensus protocols using messages gossiped among all validators, and second as an on-chain record of this off-chain protocols' progress after the fact.  We need the on-chain protocol to provide rewards for the off-chain protocol.</p>
<p>Approval requires two gossiped message types, assignment notices created by its assignments subsystem, and approval votes sent by our approval checks subsystem when authorized by the candidate validity utility subsystem.</p>
<h3 id="approval-keys"><a class="header" href="#approval-keys">Approval keys</a></h3>
<p>We need two separate keys for the approval subsystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Approval assignment keys</strong> are sr25519/schnorrkel keys used only for the assignment criteria VRFs.  We implicitly sign assignment notices with approval assignment keys by including their relay chain context and additional data in the VRF's extra message, but exclude these from its VRF input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Approval vote keys</strong> would only sign off on candidate parablock validity and has no natural key type restrictions. There's no need for this to actually embody a new session key type. We just want to make a distinction between assignments and approvals, although distant future node configurations might favor separate roles. We re-use the same keys as are used for parachain backing in practice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Approval vote keys could relatively easily be handled by some hardened signer tooling, perhaps even HSMs assuming we select ed25519 for approval vote keys.  Approval assignment keys might or might not support hardened signer tooling, but doing so sounds far more complex.  In fact, assignment keys determine only VRF outputs that determine approval checker assignments, for which they can only act or not act, so they cannot equivocate, lie, etc. and represent little if any slashing risk for validator operators.</p>
<p>In future, we shall determine which among the several hardening techniques best benefits the network as a whole.  We could provide a multi-process multi-machine architecture for validators, perhaps even reminiscent of GNUNet, or perhaps more resembling smart HSM tooling.  We might instead design a system that more resembled full systems, like like Cosmos' sentry nodes.  In either case, approval assignments might be handled by a slightly hardened machine, but not necessarily nearly as hardened as approval votes, but approval votes machines must similarly run foreign WASM code, which increases their risk, so assignments being separate sounds helpful.</p>
<h2 id="assignments"><a class="header" href="#assignments">Assignments</a></h2>
<p>Approval assignment determines on which candidate parachain blocks each validator performs approval checks.  An approval session considers only one relay chain block and assigns only those candidates that relay chain block declares available.</p>
<p>Assignment balances several concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>limits adversaries' foreknowledge about assignments,</li>
<li>ensures enough checkers, and</li>
<li>distributes assignments relatively equitably.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assignees determine their own assignments to check specific candidates using two or three assignment criteria.  Assignees never reveal their assignments until relevant, and gossip delays assignments sent early, which limits others' foreknowledge.  Assignees learn their assignment only with the relay chain block.</p>
<p>All criteria require the validator evaluate a verifiable random function (VRF) using their VRF secret key.  All criteria input specific data called &quot;stories&quot; about the session's relay chain block, and output candidates to check and a precedence called a <code>DelayTranche</code>.</p>
<p>We liberate availability cores when their candidate becomes available of course, but one approval assignment criteria continues associating each candidate with the core number it occupied when it became available.</p>
<p>Assignment operates in loosely timed rounds determined by this <code>DelayTranche</code>s, which proceed roughly 12 times faster than six second block production assuming half second gossip times.  If a candidate <code>C</code> needs more approval checkers by the time we reach round <code>t</code> then any validators with an assignment to <code>C</code> in delay tranche <code>t</code> gossip their send assignment notice for <code>C</code>.  We continue until all candidates have enough approval checkers assigned.  We take entire tranches together if we do not yet have enough, so we expect strictly more than enough checkers.  We also take later tranches if some checkers return their approval votes too slow (see no shows below).</p>
<p>Assignment ensures validators check those relay chain blocks for which they have delay tranche zero aka the highest precedence, so that adversaries always face honest checkers equal to the expected number of assignments with delay tranche zero.</p>
<p>Among these criteria, the BABE VRF output provides the story for two, which reduces how frequently adversaries could position their own checkers.  We have one criterion whose story consists of the candidate's block hash plus external knowledge that a relay chain equivocation exists with a conflicting candidate.  It provides unforeseeable assignments when adversaries gain foreknowledge about the other two by committing an equivocation in relay chain block production.</p>
<h2 id="announcements--notices"><a class="header" href="#announcements--notices">Announcements / Notices</a></h2>
<p>We gossip assignment notices among nodes so that all validators know which validators should check each candidate, and if any candidate requires more checkers.</p>
<p>Assignment notices consist of a relay chain context given by a block hash, an assignment criteria, consisting of the criteria identifier and optionally a criteria specific field, an assignee identifier, and a VRF signature by the assignee, which itself consists of a VRF pre-output and a DLEQ proof.  Its VRF input consists of the criteria, usually including a criteria specific field, and a &quot;story&quot; about its relay chain context block.</p>
<p>We never include stories inside the gossip messages containing assignment notices, but require each validator reconstruct them.  We never care about assignments in the disputes process, so this does not complicate remote disputes.</p>
<p>In a Schnorr VRF, there is an extra signed message distinct from this input, which we set to the relay chain block hash.  As a result, assignment notices are self signing and can be &quot;politely&quot; gossiped without additional signatures, meaning between nodes who can compute the story from the relay chain context.  In other words, if we cannot compute the story required by an assignment notice's VRF part then our self signing property fails and we cannot verify its origin.  We could fix this with either another signature layer (64 bytes) or by including the VRF input point computed from the story (32 bytes), but doing so appears unhelpful.</p>
<p>Any validator could send their assignment notices and/or approval votes too early.  We gossip the approval votes early because they represent a major commitment by the validator.  We delay gossiping the assignment notices until they agree with our local clock however.  We also impose a politeness condition that the recipient knows the relay chain context used by the assignment notice.</p>
<h2 id="stories"><a class="header" href="#stories">Stories</a></h2>
<p>We based assignment criteria upon two possible &quot;stories&quot; about the relay chain block <code>R</code> that included the candidate aka declared the candidate available.  All stories have an output that attempts to minimize adversarial influence, which then acts as the VRF input for an assignment criteria.</p>
<p>We first have a <code>RelayVRFStory</code> that outputs the randomness from another VRF output produced by the relay chain block producer when creating <code>R</code>.  Among honest nodes, only this one relay chain block producer who creates <code>R</code> knew the story in advance, and even they knew nothing two epochs previously.</p>
<p>In BABE, we create this value calling <code>schnorrkel::vrf::VRFInOut::make_bytes</code> with a context &quot;A&amp;V RC-VRF&quot;, with the <code>VRFInOut</code> coming from either the VRF that authorized block production for primary blocks, or else from the secondary block VRF for the secondary block type.</p>
<p>In Sassafras, we shall always use the non-anonymized recycling VRF output, never the anonymized ring VRF that authorizes block production.  We do not currently know if Sassafras shall have a separate schnorrkel key, but if it reuses its ring VRF key there is an equivalent <code>ring_vrf::VRFInOut::make_bytes</code>.</p>
<p>We like that <code>RelayVRFStory</code> admits relatively few choices, but an adversary who equivocates in relay chain block production could learn assignments that depend upon the <code>RelayVRFStory</code> too early because the same relay chain VRF appears in multiple blocks.</p>
<p>We therefore provide a secondary <code>RelayEquivocationStory</code> that outputs the candidate's block hash, but only for candidate equivocations.  We say a candidate <code>C</code> in <code>R</code> is an equivocation when there exists another relay chain block <code>R1</code> that equivocates for <code>R</code> in the sense that <code>R</code> and <code>R1</code> have the same <code>RelayVRFStory</code>, but <code>R</code> contains <code>C</code> and <code>R1</code> does not contain <code>C</code>.</p>
<p>We want checkers for candidate equivocations that lie outside our preferred relay chain as well, which represents a slightly different usage for the assignments module, and might require more information in the gossip messages.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-criteria"><a class="header" href="#assignment-criteria">Assignment criteria</a></h2>
<p>Assignment criteria compute actual assignments using stories and the validators' secret approval assignment key.  Assignment criteria output a <code>Position</code> consisting of both a <code>ParaId</code> to be checked, as well as a precedence <code>DelayTranche</code> for when the assignment becomes valid.</p>
<p>Assignment criteria come in three flavors, <code>RelayVRFModulo</code>, <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> and <code>RelayEquivocation</code>.  Among these, both <code>RelayVRFModulo</code> and <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> run a VRF whose input is the output of a <code>RelayVRFStory</code>, while <code>RelayEquivocation</code> runs a VRF whose input is the output of a <code>RelayEquivocationStory</code>.</p>
<p>Among these, we have two distinct VRF output computations:</p>
<p><code>RelayVRFModulo</code> runs several distinct samples whose VRF input is the <code>RelayVRFStory</code> and the sample number.  It computes the VRF output with <code>schnorrkel::vrf::VRFInOut::make_bytes</code> using the context &quot;A&amp;V Core&quot;, reduces this number modulo the number of availability cores, and outputs the candidate just declared available by, and included by aka leaving, that availability core.  We drop any samples that return no candidate because no candidate was leaving the sampled availability core in this relay chain block.  We choose three samples initially, but we could make polkadot more secure and efficient by increasing this to four or five, and reducing the backing checks accordingly.  All successful <code>RelayVRFModulo</code> samples are assigned delay tranche zero.</p>
<p>There is no sampling process for <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> and <code>RelayEquivocation</code>.  We instead run them on specific candidates and they compute a delay from their VRF output.  <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> runs for all candidates included under, aka declared available by, a relay chain block, and inputs the associated VRF output via <code>RelayVRFStory</code>.  <code>RelayEquivocation</code> runs only on candidate block equivocations, and inputs their block hashes via the <code>RelayEquivocation</code> story.</p>
<p><code>RelayVRFDelay</code> and <code>RelayEquivocation</code> both compute their output with <code>schnorrkel::vrf::VRFInOut::make_bytes</code> using the context &quot;A&amp;V Tranche&quot; and reduce the result modulo <code>num_delay_tranches + zeroth_delay_tranche_width</code>, and consolidate results 0 through <code>zeroth_delay_tranche_width</code> to be 0.  In this way, they ensure the zeroth delay tranche has <code>zeroth_delay_tranche_width+1</code> times as many assignments as any other tranche.</p>
<p>As future work (or TODO?), we should merge assignment notices with the same delay and story using <code>vrf_merge</code>.  We cannot merge those with the same delay and different stories because <code>RelayEquivocationStory</code>s could change but <code>RelayVRFStory</code> never changes.</p>
<h2 id="announcer-and-watchertracker"><a class="header" href="#announcer-and-watchertracker">Announcer and Watcher/Tracker</a></h2>
<p>We track all validators' announced approval assignments for each candidate associated to each relay chain block, which tells us which validators were assigned to which candidates.</p>
<p>We permit at most one assignment per candidate per story per validator, so one validator could be assigned under both the <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> and <code>RelayEquivocation</code> criteria, but not under both <code>RelayVRFModulo</code> and <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> criteria, since those both use the same story.  We permit only one approval vote per candidate per validator, which counts for any applicable criteria.</p>
<p>We announce, and start checking for, our own assignments when the delay of their tranche is reached, but only if the tracker says the assignee candidate requires more approval checkers.  We never announce an assignment we believe unnecessary because early announcements gives an adversary information.  All delay tranche zero assignments always get announced, which includes all <code>RelayVRFModulo</code> assignments.</p>
<p>In other words, if some candidate <code>C</code> needs more approval checkers by the time we reach round <code>t</code> then any validators with an assignment to <code>C</code> in delay tranche <code>t</code> gossip their send assignment notice for <code>C</code>, and begin reconstruction and validation for 'C.  If however <code>C</code> reached enough assignments, then validators with later assignments skip announcing their assignments.</p>
<p>We continue until all candidates have enough approval checkers assigned.  We never prioritize assignments within tranches and count all or no assignments for a given tranche together, so we often overshoot the target number of assigned approval checkers.</p>
<h3 id="no-shows"><a class="header" href="#no-shows">No shows</a></h3>
<p>We have a &quot;no show&quot; timeout longer than one relay chain slot, so at least 6 seconds, during which we expect approval checks should succeed in reconstructing the candidate block, in redoing its erasure coding to check the candidate receipt, and finally in rechecking the candidate block itself.</p>
<p>We consider a validator a &quot;no show&quot; if they do not approve or dispute within this &quot;no show&quot; timeout from our receiving their assignment notice.  We time this from our receipt of their assignment notice instead of our imagined real time for their tranche because otherwise receiving late assignment notices creates immediate &quot;no shows&quot; and unnecessary work.</p>
<p>We worry &quot;no shows&quot; represent a validator under denial of service attack, presumably to prevent it from reconstructing the candidate, but perhaps delaying it form gossiping a dispute too.  We therefore always replace &quot;no shows&quot; by adding one entire extra delay tranche worth of validators, so such attacks always result in additional checkers.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine we need 20 checkers, but tranche zero produces only 14, and tranche one only 4, then we take all 5 from tranche two, and thus require 23 checkers for that candidate.  If one checker Charlie from tranche one or two does not respond within say 8 seconds, then we add all 7 checkers from tranche three.  If again one checker Cindy from tranche three does not respond within 8 seconds then we take all 3 checkers from tranche four.  We now have 33 checkers working on the candidate, so this escalated quickly.</p>
<p>We escalated so quickly because we worried that Charlie and Cindy might be the only honest checkers assigned to that candidate.  If therefore either Charlie or Cindy finally return an approval, then we can conclude approval, and abandon the checkers from tranche four.</p>
<p>We therefore require the &quot;no show&quot; timeout to be longer than a relay chain slot so that we can witness &quot;no shows&quot; on-chain.  We discuss below how this helps reward validators who replace &quot;no shows&quot;.</p>
<p>We avoid slashing for &quot;no shows&quot; by itself, although being &quot;no show&quot; could enter into some computation that punishes repeated poor performance, presumably replaces <code>ImOnline</code>, and we could reduce their rewards and further rewards those who filled in.</p>
<p>As future work, we foresee expanding the &quot;no show&quot; scheme to anonymize the additional checkers, like by using assignment noticed with a new criteria that employs a ring VRF and then all validators providing cover by requesting a couple erasure coded pieces, but such anonymity scheme sound extremely complex and lie far beyond our initial functionality.</p>
<h2 id="assignment-postponement"><a class="header" href="#assignment-postponement">Assignment postponement</a></h2>
<p>We expect validators could occasionally overloaded when they randomly acquire too many assignments.  All these fluctuations amortize over multiple blocks fairly well, but this slows down finality.</p>
<p>We therefore permit validators to delay sending their assignment noticed intentionally.  If nobody knows about their assignment then they avoid creating &quot;no shows&quot; and the workload progresses normally.</p>
<p>We strongly prefer if postponements come from tranches higher aka less important than zero because tranche zero checks provide somewhat more security.</p>
<p>TODO: When?  Is this optimal for the network?  etc.</p>
<h2 id="on-chain-verification"><a class="header" href="#on-chain-verification">On-chain verification</a></h2>
<p>We should verify approval on-chain to reward approval checkers. We therefore require the &quot;no show&quot; timeout to be longer than a relay chain slot so that we can witness &quot;no shows&quot; on-chain, which helps with this goal. The major challenge with an on-chain record of the off-chain process is adversarial block producers who may either censor votes or publish votes to the chain which cause other votes to be ignored and unrewarded (reward stealing).</p>
<p>In principle, all validators have some &quot;tranche&quot; at which they're assigned to the parachain candidate, which ensures we reach enough validators eventually.  As noted above, we often retract &quot;no shows&quot; when the slow validator eventually shows up, so witnessing their initially being a &quot;no show&quot; helps manage rewards.</p>
<p>We expect on-chain verification should work in two phases:  We first record assignments notices and approval votes on-chain in relay chain block, doing the VRF or regular signature verification again in block verification, and inserting chain authenticated unsigned notes into the relay chain state that contain the checker, tranche, paraid, and relay block height for each assignment notice.  We then later have another relay chain block that runs some &quot;approved&quot; intrinsic, which extract all these notes from the state and feeds them into our approval code.</p>
<p>We now encounter one niche concern in the interaction between postponement and on-chain verification:  Any validator with a tranche zero (or other low) assignment could delay sending an assignment notice, like because they postponed their assigned tranche (which is allowed).  If they later send this assignment notices right around finality time, then they race with this approved. intrinsic:  If their announcement gets on-chain (also allowed), then yes it delays finality. If it does not get on-chain, then yes we've one announcement that the off-chain consensus system says is valid, but the chain ignores for being too slow.</p>
<p>We need the chain to win in this case, but doing this requires imposing an annoyingly long overarching delay upon finality.  We might explore limits on postponement too, but this sounds much harder.</p>
<h2 id="parameters"><a class="header" href="#parameters">Parameters</a></h2>
<p>We prefer doing approval checkers assignments under <code>RelayVRFModulo</code> as opposed to <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> because <code>RelayVRFModulo</code> avoids giving individual checkers too many assignments and tranche zero assignments benefit security the most.  We suggest assigning at least 16 checkers under <code>RelayVRFModulo</code> although assignment levels have never been properly analyzed.</p>
<p>Our delay criteria <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> and <code>RelayEquivocation</code> both have two primary paramaters, expected checkers per tranche and the zeroth delay tranche width.</p>
<p>We require expected checkers per tranche to be less than three because otherwise an adversary with 1/3 stake could force all nodes into checking all blocks.  We strongly recommend expected checkers per tranche to be less than two, which helps avoid both accidental and intentional explosions.  We also suggest expected checkers per tranche be larger than one, which helps prevent adversaries from predicting than advancing one tranche adds only their own validators.</p>
<p>We improve security more with tranche zero assignments, so <code>RelayEquivocation</code> should consolidates its first several tranches into tranche zero.  We describe this as the zeroth delay tranche width, which initially we set to 12 for <code>RelayEquivocation</code> and <code>1</code> for <code>RelayVRFDelay</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why-vrfs"><a class="header" href="#why-vrfs">Why VRFs?</a></h2>
<p>We do assignments with VRFs to give &quot;enough&quot; checkers some meaning beyond merely &quot;expected&quot; checkers:</p>
<p>We could specify a protocol that used only system randomness, which works because our strongest defense is the expected number of honest checkers who assign themselves.  In this, adversaries could trivially flood their own blocks with their own checkers, so this strong defense becomes our only defense, and delay tranches become useless, so some blocks actually have zero approval checkers and possibly only one checker overall.</p>
<p>VRFs though require adversaries wait far longer between such attacks, which also helps against adversaries with little at stake because they compromised validators.  VRFs raise user confidence that no such &quot;drive by&quot; attacks occurred because the delay tranche system ensure at least some minimum number of approval checkers.  In this vein, VRFs permit reducing backing checks and increasing approval checks, which makes polkadot more efficient.</p>
<h2 id="gossip"><a class="header" href="#gossip">Gossip</a></h2>
<p>Any validator could send their assignment notices and/or approval votes too early.  We gossip the approval votes because they represent a major commitment by the validator.  We retain but delay gossiping the assignment notices until they agree with our local clock.</p>
<p>Assignment notices being gossiped too early might create a denial of service vector.  If so, we might exploit the relative time scheme that synchronizes our clocks, which conceivably permits just dropping excessively early assignments.</p>
<h2 id="finality-grandpa-voting-rule"><a class="header" href="#finality-grandpa-voting-rule">Finality GRANDPA Voting Rule</a></h2>
<p>The relay-chain requires validators to participate in GRANDPA. In GRANDPA, validators submit off-chain votes on what they believe to be the best block of the chain, and GRANDPA determines the common block contained by a supermajority of sub-chains. There are also additional constraints on what can be submitted based on results of previous rounds of voting.</p>
<p>In order to avoid finalizing anything which has not received enough approval votes or is disputed, we will pair the approval protocol with an alteration to the GRANDPA voting strategy for honest nodes which causes them to vote only on chains where every parachain candidate within has been approved.  Furthermore, the voting rule prevents voting for chains where there is any live dispute or any dispute has resolved to a candidate being invalid.</p>
<p>Thus, the finalized relay-chain should contain only relay-chain blocks where a majority believe that every block within has been sufficiently approved.</p>
<h3 id="future-work"><a class="header" href="#future-work">Future work</a></h3>
<p>We could consider additional gossip messages with which nodes claims &quot;slow availability&quot; and/or &quot;slow candidate&quot; to fine tune the assignments &quot;no show&quot; system, but long enough &quot;no show&quot; delays suffice probably.</p>
<p>We shall develop more practical experience with UDP once the availability system works using direct UDP connections.  In this, we should discover if reconstruction performs adequately with a complete graphs or
benefits from topology restrictions.  At this point, an assignment notices could implicitly request pieces from a random 1/3rd, perhaps topology restricted, which saves one gossip round.  If this preliminary fast reconstruction fails, then nodes' request alternative pieces directly.  There is an interesting design space in how this overlaps with &quot;slow availability&quot; claims.</p>

<p>Fast forward to <a href="./disputes-flow.html">more detailed disputes requirements</a>.</p>
<h2 id="motivation-and-background"><a class="header" href="#motivation-and-background">Motivation and Background</a></h2>
<p>All parachain blocks that end up in the finalized relay chain should be valid. This does not apply to blocks that are only backed, but not included.</p>
<p>We have two primary components for ensuring that nothing invalid ends up in the finalized relay chain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approval Checking, as described <a href="./protocol-approval.html">here</a> and implemented according to the <a href="node/approval/approval-voting.html">Approval Voting</a> subsystem. This protocol can be shown to prevent invalid parachain blocks from making their way into the finalized relay chain as long as the amount of attempts are limited.</li>
<li>Disputes, this protocol, which ensures that each attempt to include something bad is caught, and the offending validators are punished.
Disputes differ from backing and approval process (and can not be part of those) in that a dispute is independent of a particular fork, while both backing and approval operate on particular forks. This distinction is important! Approval voting stops, if an alternative fork which might not contain the currently approved candidate gets finalized. This is totally fine from the perspective of approval voting as its sole purpose is to make sure invalid blocks won't get finalized. For disputes on the other hand we have different requirements: Even though the &quot;danger&quot; is past and the adversaries were not able to get their invalid block approved, we still want them to get slashed for the attempt. Otherwise they just have been able to get a free try, but this is something we need to avoid in our security model, as it is based on the assumption that the probability of getting an invalid block finalized is very low and an attacker would get bankrupt before it could have tried often enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every dispute stems from a disagreement among two or more validators. If a bad actor creates a bad block, but the bad actor never distributes it to honest validators, then nobody will dispute it. Of course, such a situation is not even an attack on the network, so we don't need to worry about defending against it.</p>
<p>From most to least important, here are the attack scenarios we are interested in identifying and deterring:</p>
<ul>
<li>A parablock included on a branch of the relay chain is bad</li>
<li>A parablock backed on a branch of the relay chain is bad</li>
<li>A parablock seconded, but not backed on any branch of the relay chain, is bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>As covered in the <a href="./protocol-overview.html">protocol overview</a>, checking a parachain block requires 3 pieces of data: the parachain validation code, the <a href="types/availability.html"><code>AvailableData</code></a>, and the <a href="types/candidate.html"><code>CandidateReceipt</code></a>. The validation code is available on-chain, and published ahead of time, so that no two branches of the relay chain have diverging views of the validation code for a given parachain. Note that only for the first scenario, where the parablock has been included on a branch of the relay chain, is the data necessarily available. Thus, dispute processes should begin with an availability process to ensure availability of the <code>AvailableData</code>. This availability process will conclude quickly if the data is already available. If the data is not already available, then the initiator of the dispute must make it available.</p>
<p>Disputes have both an on-chain and an off-chain component. Slashing and punishment is handled on-chain, so votes by validators on either side of the dispute must be placed on-chain. Furthermore, a dispute on one branch of the relay chain should be transposed to all other active branches of the relay chain. The fact that slashing occurs <em>in all histories</em> is crucial for deterring attempts to attack the network. The attacker should not be able to escape with their funds because the network has moved on to another branch of the relay chain where no attack was attempted.</p>
<p>In fact, this is why we introduce a distinction between <em>local</em> and <em>remote</em> disputes. We categorize disputes as either local or remote relative to any particular branch of the relay chain. Local disputes are about dealing with our first scenario, where a parablock has been included on the specific branch we are looking at. In these cases, the chain is corrupted all the way back to the point where the parablock was backed and must be discarded. However, as mentioned before, the dispute must propagate to all other branches of the relay chain. All other disputes are considered <em>remote</em>. For the on-chain component, when handling a dispute for a block which was not included in the current fork of the relay chain, it is impossible to discern between our attack scenarios. It is possible that the parablock was included somewhere, or backed somewhere, or wasn't backed anywhere. The on-chain component for handling these cases will be the same.</p>
<h2 id="initiation"><a class="header" href="#initiation">Initiation</a></h2>
<p>Disputes are initiated by any validator who finds their opinion on the validity of a parablock in opposition to another issued statement. As all statements currently gathered by the relay chain imply validity, disputes will be initiated only by nodes which perceive that the parablock is bad.</p>
<p>The initiation of a dispute begins off-chain. A validator signs a message indicating that it disputes the validity of the parablock and notifies all other validators, off-chain, of all of the statements it is aware of for the disputed parablock. These may be backing statements or approval-checking statements. It is worth noting that there is no special message type for initiating a dispute. It is the same message as is used to participate in a dispute and vote negatively. As such, there is no consensus required on who initiated a dispute, only on the fact that there is a dispute in-progress.</p>
<p>In practice, the initiator of a dispute will be either one of the backers or one of the approval checkers for the parablock. If the result of execution is found to be invalid, the validator will initiate the dispute as described above. Furthermore, if the dispute occurs during the backing phase, the initiator must make the data available to other validators. If the dispute occurs during approval checking, the data is already available.</p>
<p>Lastly, it is possible that for backing disputes, i.e. where the data is not already available among all validators, that an adversary may DoS the few parties who are checking the block to prevent them from distributing the data to other validators participating in the dispute process. Note that this can only occur pre-inclusion for any given parablock, so the downside of this attack is small and it is not security-critical to address these cases. However, we assume that the adversary can only prevent the validator from issuing messages for a limited amount of time. We also assume that there is a side-channel where the relay chain's governance mechanisms can trigger disputes by providing the full PoV and candidate receipt on-chain manually.</p>
<h2 id="dispute-participation"><a class="header" href="#dispute-participation">Dispute Participation</a></h2>
<p>Once becoming aware of a dispute, it is the responsibility of all validators to participate in the dispute. Concretely, this means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Circulate all statements about the candidate that we are aware of - backing statements, approval checking statements, and dispute statements.</li>
<li>If we have already issued any type of statement about the candidate, go no further.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="types/availability.html"><code>AvailableData</code></a>. If possible, this should first be attempted from other dispute participants or backing validators, and then <a href="node/availability/availability-recovery.html">(via erasure-coding)</a> from all validators.</li>
<li>Extract the Validation Code from any recent relay chain block. Code is guaranteed to be kept available on-chain, so we don't need to download any particular fork of the chain.</li>
<li>Execute the block under the validation code, using the <code>AvailableData</code>, and check that all outputs are correct, including the <code>erasure-root</code> of the <a href="types/candidate.html"><code>CandidateReceipt</code></a>.</li>
<li>Issue a dispute participation statement to the effect of the validity of the candidate block.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disputes <em>conclude</em> after ⅔ supermajority is reached in either direction.</p>
<p>The on-chain component of disputes can be initiated by providing any two conflicting votes and it also waits for a ⅔ supermajority on either side. The on-chain component also tracks which parablocks have already been disputed so the same parablock may only be disputed once on any particular branch of the relay chain. Lastly, it also tracks which blocks have been included on the current branch of the relay chain. When a dispute is initiated for a para, inclusion is halted for the para until the dispute concludes.</p>
<p>The author of a relay chain block should initiate the on-chain component of disputes for all disputes which the chain is not aware of, and provide all statements to the on-chain component as well. This should all be done via <em>inherents</em>.</p>
<p>Validators can learn about dispute statements in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receiving them from other validators over gossip</li>
<li>Scraping them from imported blocks of the relay chain. This is also used for validators to track other types of statements, such as backing statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Validators are rewarded for providing statements to the chain as well as for participating in the dispute, on either side. However, the losing side of the dispute is slashed.</p>
<h2 id="dispute-conclusion"><a class="header" href="#dispute-conclusion">Dispute Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Disputes, roughly, are over when one side reaches a ⅔ supermajority. They may also conclude after a timeout, without either side witnessing supermajority, which will only happen if the majority of validators are unable to vote for some reason. Furthermore, disputes on-chain will stay open for some fixed amount of time even after concluding, to accept new votes.</p>
<p>Late votes, after the dispute already reached a ⅔ supermajority, must be rewarded (albeit a smaller amount) as well.</p>

<h2 id="conditional-formulation"><a class="header" href="#conditional-formulation">Conditional formulation</a></h2>
<p>The set of validators eligible to vote consists of
the validators that had duty at the time of backing, plus backing votes by the backing validators.</p>
<p>If a validator receives an initial dispute message (a set of votes where there are at least two opposing votes contained), and the PoV or Code are hence not reconstructable from local storage, that validator must request the required data from its peers.</p>
<p>The dispute availability message must contain code, persisted validation data, and the proof of validity.</p>
<p>Only peers that already voted shall be queried for the dispute availability data.</p>
<p>The peer to be queried for disputes data, must be picked at random.</p>
<p>A validator must retain code, persisted validation data and PoV until a block, that contains the dispute resolution, is finalized - plus an additional 24 hours.</p>
<p>Dispute availability gossip must continue beyond the dispute resolution, until the post resolution timeout expired (equiv to the timeout until which additional late votes are accepted).</p>
<p>Remote disputes are disputes that are in relation to a chain that is not part of the local validators active heads.</p>
<p>All incoming votes must be persisted.</p>
<p>Persisted votes stay persisted for <code>N</code> sessions, and are cleaned up on a per session basis.</p>
<p>Votes must be queryable by a particular validator, identified by its signing key.</p>
<p>Votes must be queryable by a particular validator, identified by a session index and the validator index valid in that session.</p>
<p>If there exists a negative and a positive vote for a particular block, a dispute is detected.</p>
<p>If a dispute is detected, all currently available votes for that block must be gossiped.</p>
<p>If an incoming dispute vote is detected, a validator must cast their own vote. The vote is determined by validating the PoV with the Code at the time of backing the block in question.</p>
<p>If the validator was also a backer of the block, validation and casting an additional vote should be skipped.</p>
<p>If the count of votes pro or cons regarding the disputed block, reaches the required ⅔ supermajority (including the backing votes), the conclusion must be recorded on chain and the voters on the loosing and no-shows being slashed appropriately.</p>
<p>If a block is found invalid by a dispute resolution, it must be blacklisted to avoid resync or further build on that chain if other chains are available (to be detailed in the grandpa fork choice rule).</p>
<p>A dispute accepts Votes after the dispute is resolved, for 1 day.</p>
<p>If a vote is received, after the dispute is resolved, the vote shall still be recorded in the state root, albeit yielding less reward.</p>
<p>Recording in the state root might happen batched, at timeout expiry.</p>
<p>If a new active head/chain appears, and the dispute resolution was not recorded on that chain yet, the dispute resolution or open dispute must be recorded / transplanted to that chain as well, since the disputes must be present on all chains to make sure the offender is punished.</p>
<p>If a validator votes in two opposing ways, this composes of a double vote like in other cases (backing, approval voting).</p>
<p>If a dispute is not resolved within due time, all validators are to be slashed for a small amount.</p>
<p>If a dispute is not resolved within due time, governance mode shall be entered for manual resolution.</p>
<p>If a validator unexpectedly restarts, the dispute shall be continued with the state based on votes being cast and being present in persistent storage.</p>

<p>Chain selection processes in blockchains are used for the purpose of selecting blocks to build on and finalize. It is important for these processes to be consistent among nodes and resilient to a maximum proportion of malicious nodes which do not obey the chain selection process.</p>
<p>The parachain host uses both a block authoring system and a finality gadget. The chain selection strategy of the parachain host involves two key components: a <em>leaf-selection</em> rule and a set of <em>finality constraints</em>. When it's a validator's turn to author on a block, they are expected to select the best block via the leaf-selection rule to build on top of. When a validator is participating in finality, there is a minimum block which can be voted on, which is usually the finalized block. The validator should select the best chain according to the leaf-selection rule and subsequently apply the finality constraints to arrive at the actual vote cast by that validator.</p>
<p>Before diving into the particularities of the leaf-selection rule and the finality constraints, it's important to discuss the goals that these components are meant to achieve. For this it is useful to create the definitions of <em>viable</em> and <em>finalizable</em> blocks.</p>
<h3 id="property-definitions"><a class="header" href="#property-definitions">Property Definitions</a></h3>
<p>A block is considered <strong>viable</strong> when all of the following hold:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is or descends from the finalized block</li>
<li>It is not <strong>stagnant</strong></li>
<li>It is not <strong>reverted</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A block is considered a <strong>viable leaf</strong> when all of the following hold:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is <strong>viable</strong></li>
<li>It has no <strong>viable</strong> descendant.</li>
</ol>
<p>A block is considered <strong>stagnant</strong> when either:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is unfinalized, is not approved, and has not been approved within 2 minutes</li>
<li>Its parent is <strong>stagnant</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>A block is considered <strong>reverted</strong> when either:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is unfinalized and includes a candidate which has lost a dispute</li>
<li>Its parent is <strong>reverted</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A block is considered <strong>finalizable</strong> when all of the following hold:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is <strong>viable</strong></li>
<li>Its parent, if unfinalized, is <strong>finalizable</strong>.</li>
<li>It is either finalized or approved.</li>
<li>It is either finalized or includes no candidates which have unresolved disputes or have lost a dispute.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-leaf-selection-rule"><a class="header" href="#the-leaf-selection-rule">The leaf-selection rule</a></h3>
<p>We assume that every block has an implicit weight or score which can be used to compare blocks. In BABE, this is determined by the number of primary slots included in the chain. In PoW, this is the chain with either the most work or GHOST weight.</p>
<p>The leaf-selection rule based on our definitions above is simple: we take the maximum-scoring viable leaf we are aware of. In the case of a tie we select the one with a lower lexicographical block hash.</p>
<h3 id="the-best-chain-containing-rule"><a class="header" href="#the-best-chain-containing-rule">The best-chain-containing rule</a></h3>
<p>Finality gadgets, as mentioned above, will often impose an additional requirement to vote on a chain containing a specific block, known as the <strong>required</strong> block. Although this is typically the most recently finalized block, it is possible that it may be a block that is unfinalized. When receiving such a request:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the required block is the best finalized block, then select the best viable leaf.</li>
<li>If the required block is unfinalized and non-viable, then select the required block and go no further. This is likely an indication that something bad will be finalized in the network, which will never happen when approvals &amp; disputes are functioning correctly. Nevertheless we account for the case here.</li>
<li>If the required block is unfinalized and viable, then iterate over the viable leaves in descending order by score and select the first one which contains the required block in its chain. Backwards iteration is a simple way to check this, but if unfinalized chains grow long then Merkle Mountain-Ranges will most likely be more efficient.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once selecting a leaf, the chain should be constrained to the maximum of the required block or the highest <strong>finalizable</strong> ancestor.</p>

<p>This section aims to describe, at a high level, the code architecture and subsystems involved in the implementation of an individual Parachain Host. It also illuminates certain subtleties and challenges faced in the design and implementation of those subsystems.</p>
<p>To recap, Polkadot includes a blockchain known as the relay-chain. A blockchain is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of state transitions, where every block can be considered to be the head of a linked-list (known as a &quot;chain&quot; or &quot;fork&quot;) with a cumulative state which is determined by applying the state transition of each block in turn. All paths through the DAG terminate at the Genesis Block. In fact, the blockchain is a tree, since each block can have only one parent.</p>

<p>A blockchain network is comprised of nodes. These nodes each have a view of many different forks of a blockchain and must decide which forks to follow and what actions to take based on the forks of the chain that they are aware of.</p>
<p>So in specifying an architecture to carry out the functionality of a Parachain Host, we have to answer two categories of questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the state-transition function of the blockchain? What is necessary for a transition to be considered valid, and what information is carried within the implicit state of a block?</li>
<li>Being aware of various forks of the blockchain as well as global private state such as a view of the current time, what behaviors should a node undertake? What information should a node extract from the state of which forks, and how should that information be used?</li>
</ol>
<p>The first category of questions will be addressed by the Runtime, which defines the state-transition logic of the chain. Runtime logic only has to focus on the perspective of one chain, as each state has only a single parent state.</p>
<p>The second category of questions addressed by Node-side behavior. Node-side behavior defines all activities that a node undertakes, given its view of the blockchain/block-DAG. Node-side behavior can take into account all or many of the forks of the blockchain, and only conditionally undertake certain activities based on which forks it is aware of, as well as the state of the head of those forks.</p>

<p>It is also helpful to divide Node-side behavior into two further categories: Networking and Core. Networking behaviors relate to how information is distributed between nodes. Core behaviors relate to internal work that a specific node does. These two categories of behavior often interact, but can be heavily abstracted from each other. Core behaviors care that information is distributed and received, but not the internal details of how distribution and receipt function. Networking behaviors act on requests for distribution or fetching of information, but are not concerned with how the information is used afterwards. This allows us to create clean boundaries between Core and Networking activities, improving the modularity of the code.</p>

<p>Node-side behavior is split up into various subsystems. Subsystems are long-lived workers that perform a particular category of work. Subsystems can communicate with each other, and do so via an <a href="node/overseer.html">Overseer</a> that prevents race conditions.</p>
<p>Runtime logic is divided up into Modules and APIs. Modules encapsulate particular behavior of the system. Modules consist of storage, routines, and entry-points. Routines are invoked by entry points, by other modules, upon block initialization or closing. Routines can read and alter the storage of the module. Entry-points are the means by which new information is introduced to a module and can limit the origins (user, root, parachain) that they accept being called by. Each block in the blockchain contains a set of Extrinsics. Each extrinsic targets a a specific entry point to trigger and which data should be passed to it. Runtime APIs provide a means for Node-side behavior to extract meaningful information from the state of a single fork.</p>
<p>These two aspects of the implementation are heavily dependent on each other. The Runtime depends on Node-side behavior to author blocks, and to include Extrinsics which trigger the correct entry points. The Node-side behavior relies on Runtime APIs to extract information necessary to determine which actions to take.</p>

<p>The Polkadot Host has a few mechanisms that are responsible for message passing. They can be generally divided
on two categories: Horizontal and Vertical. Horizontal Message Passing (HMP) refers to mechanisms
that are responsible for exchanging messages between parachains. Vertical Message Passing (VMP) is
used for communication between the relay chain and parachains.</p>

<p>Downward Message Passing (DMP) is a mechanism for delivering messages to parachains from the relay chain.</p>
<p>Each parachain has its own queue that stores all pending inbound downward messages. A parachain
doesn't have to process all messages at once, however, there are rules as to how the downward message queue
should be processed. Currently, at least one message must be consumed per candidate if the queue is not empty.
The downward message queue doesn't have a cap on its size and it is up to the relay-chain to put mechanisms
that prevent spamming in place.</p>
<p>Upward Message Passing (UMP) is a mechanism responsible for delivering messages in the opposite direction:
from a parachain up to the relay chain. Upward messages are essentially byte blobs. However, they are interpreted
by the relay-chain according to the XCM standard.</p>
<p>The XCM standard is a common vocabulary of messages. The XCM standard doesn't require a particular interpretation of
a message. However, the parachains host (e.g. Polkadot) guarantees certain semantics for those.</p>
<p>Moreover, while most XCM messages are handled by the on-chain XCM interpreter, some of the messages are special
cased. Specifically, those messages can be checked during the acceptance criteria and thus invalid
messages would lead to rejecting the candidate itself.</p>
<p>One kind of such a message is <code>Xcm::Transact</code>. This upward message can be seen as a way for a parachain
to execute arbitrary entrypoints on the relay-chain. <code>Xcm::Transact</code> messages resemble regular extrinsics with the exception that they
originate from a parachain.</p>
<p>The payload of <code>Xcm::Transact</code> messages is referred as to <code>Dispatchable</code>. When a candidate with such a message is enacted
the dispatchables are put into a queue corresponding to the parachain. There can be only so many dispatchables in that queue at once.
The weight that processing of the dispatchables can consume is limited by a preconfigured value. Therefore, it is possible
that some dispatchables will be left for later blocks. To make the dispatching more fair, the queues are processed turn-by-turn
in a round robin fashion.</p>
<p>The second category of special cased XCM messages are for horizontal messaging channel management,
namely messages meant to request opening and closing HRMP channels (HRMP will be described below).</p>

<p>The most important member of this family is XCMP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ℹ️ XCMP is currently under construction and details are subject for change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>XCMP is a message passing mechanism between parachains that require minimal involvement of the relay chain.
The relay chain provides means for sending parachains to authenticate messages sent to recipient parachains.</p>
<p>Semantically communication occurs through so called channels. A channel is unidirectional and it has
two endpoints, for sender and for recipient. A channel can be opened only if the both parties agree
and closed unilaterally.</p>
<p>Only the channel metadata is stored on the relay-chain in a very compact form: all messages and their
contents sent by the sender parachain are encoded using only one root hash. This root is referred as
MQC head.</p>
<p>The authenticity of the messages must be proven using that root hash to the receiving party at the
candidate authoring time. The proof stems from the relay parent storage that contains the root hash of the channel.
Since not all messages are required to be processed by the receiver's candidate, only the processed
messages are supplied (i.e. preimages), rest are provided as hashes.</p>
<p>Further details can be found at the official repository for the
<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/xcm-format/blob/master/README.md">Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM)</a>, as well as
at the <a href="https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/XCMP.html">W3F research website</a> and
<a href="https://medium.com/web3foundation/polkadots-messaging-scheme-b1ec560908b7">this blogpost</a>.</p>
<p>HRMP (Horizontally Relay-routed Message Passing) is a stop gap that predates XCMP. Semantically, it mimics XCMP's interface.
The crucial difference from XCMP though is that all the messages are stored in the relay-chain storage. That makes
things simple but at the same time that makes HRMP more demanding in terms of resources thus making it more expensive.</p>
<p>Once XCMP is available we expect to retire HRMP.</p>

<h2 id="motivation"><a class="header" href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Parachains' and parathreads' validation function is described by a wasm module that we refer to as a PVF. Since a PVF is a wasm module the typical way of executing it is to compile it to machine code.</p>
<p>Typically an optimizing compiler consists of algorithms that are able to optimize the resulting machine code heavily. However, while those algorithms perform quite well for a typical wasm code produced by standard toolchains (e.g. rustc/LLVM), those algorithms can be abused to consume a lot of resources. Moreover, since those algorithms are rather complex there is a lot of room for a bug that can crash the compiler.</p>
<p>If compilation of a Parachain Validation Function (PVF) takes too long or uses too much memory, this can leave a node in limbo as to whether a candidate of that parachain is valid or not.</p>
<p>The amount of time that a PVF takes to compile is a subjective resource limit and as such PVFs may be maliciously crafted so that there is e.g. a 50/50 split of validators which can and cannot compile and execute the PVF.</p>
<p>This has the following implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>In backing, inclusion may be slow due to backing groups being unable to execute the block</li>
<li>In approval checking, there may be many no-shows, leading to slow finality</li>
<li>In disputes, neither side may reach supermajority. Nobody will get slashed and the chain will not be reverted or finalized.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of this issue we need a fairly hard guarantee that the PVFs of registered parachains/threads can be compiled within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<h2 id="solution"><a class="header" href="#solution">Solution</a></h2>
<p>The problem is solved by having a pre-checking process which is run when a new validation code is included in the chain. A new PVF can be added in two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new parachain or parathread is registered.</li>
<li>An existing parachain or parathread signalled an upgrade of its validation code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before any of those operations finish, the PVF pre-checking vote is initiated. The PVF pre-checking vote is identified by the PVF code hash that is being voted on. If there is already PVF pre-checking process running, then no
new PVF pre-checking vote will be started. Instead, the operation just subscribes to the existing vote.</p>
<p>The pre-checking vote can be concluded either by obtaining a supermajority or if it expires.</p>
<p>Each validator checks the list of PVFs available for voting. The vote is binary, i.e. accept or reject a given PVF. As soon as the supermajority of votes are collected for one of the sides of the vote, the voting is concluded in that direction and the effects of the voting are enacted.</p>
<p>Only validators from the active set can participate in the vote. The set of active validators can change each session. That's why we reset the votes each session. A voting that observed a certain number of sessions will be rejected.</p>
<p>The effects of the PVF accepting depend on the operations requested it:</p>
<ol>
<li>All onboardings subscribed to the approved PVF pre-checking process will get scheduled and after passing 2 session boundaries they will be onboarded.</li>
<li>All upgrades subscribed to the approved PVF pre-checking process will get scheduled very similarly to the existing process. Upgrades with pre-checking are really the same process that is just delayed by the time required for pre-checking voting. In case of instant approval the mechanism is exactly the same.</li>
</ol>
<p>In case PVF pre-checking process was concluded with rejection, then all the operations that are subscribed to the rejected PVF pre-checking process will be processed as follows. That is, onboarding or upgrading will be cancelled.</p>
<p>The logic described above is implemented by the <a href="runtime/paras.html">paras</a> module.</p>
<p>On the node-side, there is a PVF pre-checking <a href="node/utility/pvf-prechecker.html">subsystem</a> that scans the chain for new PVFs via using <a href="runtime-api/pvf-prechecking.html">runtime APIs</a>. Upon finding a new PVF, the subsystem will initiate a PVF pre-checking request and wait for the result. Whenever the result is obtained, the subsystem will use the <a href="runtime-api/pvf-prechecking.html">runtime API</a> to submit a vote for the PVF. The vote is an unsigned transaction. The vote will be distributed via the gossip similarly to a normal transaction. Eventually a block producer will include the vote into the block where it will be handled by the <a href="runtime/paras.html">runtime</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pre-checking-summary"><a class="header" href="#pre-checking-summary">Pre-checking Summary</a></h2>
<p>Parachains' and parathreads' validation function is described by a wasm module that we refer to as a PVF.</p>
<p>In order to make the PVF usable for candidate validation it has to be registered on-chain.</p>
<p>As part of the registration process, it has to go through pre-checking. Pre-checking is a game of attempting preparation and reporting the results back on-chain.</p>
<p>We define preparation as a process that: validates the consistency of the wasm binary (aka prevalidation) and the compilation of the wasm module into machine code (refered to as artifact).</p>
<p>Besides pre-checking, preparation can also be triggered by execution, since a compiled artifact is needed for the execution. If an artifact already exists, execution will skip preparation. If it does do preparation, execution uses a more lenient timeout than preparation, to avoid the situation where honest validators fail on valid, pre-checked PVFs.</p>

<p>It's clear that we want to separate different aspects of the runtime logic into different modules. Modules define their own storage, routines, and entry-points. They also define initialization and finalization logic.</p>
<p>Due to the (lack of) guarantees provided by a particular blockchain-runtime framework, there is no defined or dependable order in which modules' initialization or finalization logic will run. Supporting this blockchain-runtime framework is important enough to include that same uncertainty in our model of runtime modules in this guide. Furthermore, initialization logic of modules can trigger the entry-points or routines of other modules. This is one architectural pressure against dividing the runtime logic into multiple modules. However, in this case the benefits of splitting things up outweigh the costs, provided that we take certain precautions against initialization and entry-point races.</p>
<p>We also expect, although it's beyond the scope of this guide, that these runtime modules will exist alongside various other modules. This has two facets to consider. First, even if the modules that we describe here don't invoke each others' entry points or routines during initialization, we still have to protect against those other modules doing that. Second, some of those modules are expected to provide governance capabilities for the chain. Configuration exposed by parachain-host modules is mostly for the benefit of these governance modules, to allow the operators or community of the chain to tweak parameters.</p>
<p>The runtime's primary roles to manage scheduling and updating of parachains and parathreads, as well as handling misbehavior reports and slashing. This guide doesn't focus on how parachains or parathreads are registered, only that they are. Also, this runtime description assumes that validator sets are selected somehow, but doesn't assume any other details than a periodic <em>session change</em> event. Session changes give information about the incoming validator set and the validator set of the following session.</p>
<p>The runtime also serves another role, which is to make data available to the Node-side logic via Runtime APIs. These Runtime APIs should be sufficient for the Node-side code to author blocks correctly.</p>
<p>There is some functionality of the relay chain relating to parachains that we also consider beyond the scope of this document. In particular, all modules related to how parachains are registered aren't part of this guide, although we do provide routines that should be called by the registration process.</p>
<p>We will split the logic of the runtime up into these modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initializer: manage initialization order of the other modules.</li>
<li>Shared: manages shared storage and configurations for other modules.</li>
<li>Configuration: manage configuration and configuration updates in a non-racy manner.</li>
<li>Paras: manage chain-head and validation code for parachains and parathreads.</li>
<li>Scheduler: manages parachain and parathread scheduling as well as validator assignments.</li>
<li>Inclusion: handles the inclusion and availability of scheduled parachains and parathreads.</li>
<li>Validity: handles secondary checks and dispute resolution for included, available parablocks.</li>
<li>HRMP: handles horizontal messages between paras.</li>
<li>UMP: Handles upward messages from a para to the relay chain.</li>
<li>DMP: Handles downward messages from the relay chain to the para.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="runtime/initializer.html">Initializer module</a> is special - it's responsible for handling the initialization logic of the other modules to ensure that the correct initialization order and related invariants are maintained. The other modules won't specify a on-initialize logic, but will instead expose a special semi-private routine that the initialization module will call. The other modules are relatively straightforward and perform the roles described above.</p>
<p>The Parachain Host operates under a changing set of validators. Time is split up into periodic sessions, where each session brings a potentially new set of validators. Sessions are buffered by one, meaning that the validators of the upcoming session <code>n+1</code> are determined at the end of session <code>n-1</code>, right before session <code>n</code> starts. Parachain Host runtime modules need to react to changes in the validator set, as it will affect the runtime logic for processing candidate backing, availability bitfields, and misbehavior reports. The Parachain Host modules can't determine ahead-of-time exactly when session change notifications are going to happen within the block (note: this depends on module initialization order again - better to put session before parachains modules).</p>
<p>The relay chain is intended to use BABE or SASSAFRAS, which both have the property that a session changing at a block is determined not by the number of the block but instead by the time the block is authored. In some sense, sessions change in-between blocks, not at blocks. This has the side effect that the session of a child block cannot be determined solely by the parent block's identifier. Being able to unilaterally determine the validator-set at a specific block based on its parent hash would make a lot of Node-side logic much simpler.</p>
<p>In order to regain the property that the validator set of a block is predictable by its parent block, we delay session changes' application to Parachains by 1 block. This means that if there is a session change at block X, that session change will be stored and applied during initialization of direct descendants of X. This principal side effect of this change is that the Parachains runtime can disagree with session or consensus modules about which session it currently is. Misbehavior reporting routines in particular will be affected by this, although not severely. The parachains runtime might believe it is the last block of the session while the system is really in the first block of the next session. In such cases, a historical validator-set membership proof will need to accompany any misbehavior report, although they typically do not need to during current-session misbehavior reports.</p>
<p>So the other role of the initializer module is to forward session change notifications to modules in the initialization order. Session change is also the point at which the <a href="runtime/configuration.html">Configuration Module</a> updates the configuration. Most of the other modules will handle changes in the configuration during their session change operation, so the initializer should provide both the old and new configuration to all the other
modules alongside the session change notification. This means that a session change notification should consist of the following data:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct SessionChangeNotification {

<p>This module is responsible for managing all configuration of the parachain host in-flight.

Both the <a href="runtime/scheduler.html">scheduler</a> and <a href="runtime/inclusion.html">inclusion</a> modules rely on this invariant to ensure proper behavior of the scheduler.</p>

<p>After a backed candidate is made available, it is included and proceeds into an acceptance period during which validators are randomly selected to do (secondary) approval checks of the parablock. Any reports disputing the validity of the candidate will cause escalation, where even more validators are requested to check the block, and so on, until either the parablock is determined to be invalid or valid. Those on the wrong side of the dispute are slashed and, if the parablock is deemed invalid, the relay chain is rolled back to a point before that block was included.</p>
<p>However, this isn't the end of the story. We are working in a forkful blockchain environment, which carries three important considerations:</p>
<ol>
<li>For security, validators that misbehave shouldn't only be slashed on one fork, but on all possible forks. Validators that misbehave shouldn't be able to create a new fork of the chain when caught and get away with their misbehavior.</li>
<li>It is possible (and likely) that the parablock being contested has not appeared on all forks.</li>
<li>If a block author believes that there is a disputed parablock on a specific fork that will resolve to a reversion of the fork, that block author has more incentive to build on a different fork which does not include that parablock.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that in all likelihood, there is the possibility of disputes that are started on one fork of the relay chain, and as soon as the dispute resolution process starts to indicate that the parablock is indeed invalid, that fork of the relay chain will be abandoned and the dispute will never be fully resolved on that chain.</p>
<p>Even if this doesn't happen, there is the possibility that there are two disputes underway, and one resolves leading to a reversion of the chain before the other has concluded. In this case we want to both transplant the concluded dispute onto other forks of the chain as well as the unconcluded dispute.</p>
<p>We account for these requirements by having the disputes module handle two kinds of disputes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Local disputes: those contesting the validity of the current fork by disputing a parablock included within it.</li>
<li>Remote disputes: a dispute that has partially or fully resolved on another fork which is transplanted to the local fork for completion and eventual slashing.</li>
</ol>
<p>When a local dispute concludes negatively, the chain needs to be abandoned and reverted back to a block where the state does not contain the bad parablock. We expect that due to the <a href="runtime/../protocol-approval.html">Approval Checking Protocol</a>, the current executing block should not be finalized. So we do two things when a local dispute concludes negatively:</p>
<ol>
<li>Freeze the state of parachains so nothing further is backed or included.</li>
<li>Issue a digest in the header of the block that signals to nodes that this branch of the chain is to be abandoned.</li>
</ol>
<p>If, as is expected, the chain is unfinalized, the freeze will have no effect as no honest validator will attempt to build on the frozen chain. However, if the approval checking protocol has failed and the bad parablock is finalized, the freeze serves to put the chain into a governance-only mode.</p>
<p>The storage of this module is designed around tracking <a href="runtime/../types/disputes.html#disputestate"><code>DisputeState</code>s</a>, updating them with votes, and tracking blocks included by this branch of the relay chain. It also contains a <code>Frozen</code> parameter designed to freeze the state of all parachains.</p>

<p>The Paras module is responsible for storing information on parachains and parathreads. Registered
parachains and parathreads cannot change except at session boundaries and after at least a full
session has passed. This is primarily to ensure that the number and meaning of bits required for the
availability bitfields does not change except at session boundaries.</p>
<p>It's also responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>managing parachain validation code upgrades as well as maintaining availability of old parachain 
code and its pruning.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>TODO: this section is still heavily under construction. key questions about availability cores and validator assignment are still open and the flow of the the section may be contradictory or inconsistent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Scheduler module is responsible for two main tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partitioning validators into groups and assigning groups to parachains and parathreads.</li>
<li>Scheduling parachains and parathreads</li>
</ul>
<p>It aims to achieve these tasks with these goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be possible to know at least a block ahead-of-time, ideally more, which validators are going to be assigned to which parachains.</li>
<li>Parachains that have a candidate pending availability in this fork of the chain should not be assigned.</li>
<li>Validator assignments should not be gameable. Malicious cartels should not be able to manipulate the scheduler to assign themselves as desired.</li>
<li>High or close to optimal throughput of parachains and parathreads. Work among validator groups should be balanced.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="availability-cores"><a class="header" href="#availability-cores">Availability Cores</a></h2>
<p>The Scheduler manages resource allocation using the concept of &quot;Availability Cores&quot;. There will be one availability core for each parachain, and a fixed number of cores used for multiplexing parathreads. Validators will be partitioned into groups, with the same number of groups as availability cores. Validator groups will be assigned to different availability cores over time.</p>
<p>An availability core can exist in either one of two states at the beginning or end of a block: free or occupied. A free availability core can have a parachain or parathread assigned to it for the potential to have a backed candidate included. After backing, the core enters the occupied state as the backed candidate is pending availability. There is an important distinction: a core is not considered occupied until it is in charge of a block pending availability, although the implementation may treat scheduled cores the same as occupied ones for brevity. A core exits the occupied state when the candidate is no longer pending availability - either on timeout or on availability. A core starting in the occupied state can move to the free state and back to occupied all within a single block, as availability bitfields are processed before backed candidates. At the end of the block, there is a possible timeout on availability which can move the core back to the free state if occupied.</p>
<p>Cores are treated as an ordered list and are typically referred to by their index in that list.</p>

<h2 id="validator-groups"><a class="header" href="#validator-groups">Validator Groups</a></h2>
<p>Validator group assignments do not need to change very quickly. The security benefits of fast rotation are redundant with the challenge mechanism in the <a href="runtime/../protocol-approval.html">Approval process</a>. Because of this, we only divide validators into groups at the beginning of the session and do not shuffle membership during the session. However, we do take steps to ensure that no particular validator group has dominance over a single parachain or parathread-multiplexer for an entire session to provide better guarantees of live-ness.</p>
<p>Validator groups rotate across availability cores in a round-robin fashion, with rotation occurring at fixed intervals. The i'th group will be assigned to the <code>(i+k)%n</code>'th core at any point in time, where <code>k</code> is the number of rotations that have occurred in the session, and <code>n</code> is the number of cores. This makes upcoming rotations within the same session predictable.</p>
<p>When a rotation occurs, validator groups are still responsible for distributing availability chunks for any previous cores that are still occupied and pending availability. In practice, rotation and availability-timeout frequencies should be set so this will only be the core they have just been rotated from. It is possible that a validator group is rotated onto a core which is currently occupied. In this case, the validator group will have nothing to do until the previously-assigned group finishes their availability work and frees the core or the availability process times out. Depending on if the core is for a parachain or parathread, a different timeout <code>t</code> from the <a href="runtime/../types/runtime.html#host-configuration"><code>HostConfiguration</code></a> will apply. Availability timeouts should only be triggered in the first <code>t-1</code> blocks after the beginning of a rotation.</p>
<h2 id="claims"><a class="header" href="#claims">Claims</a></h2>
<p>Parathreads operate on a system of claims. Collators participate in auctions to stake a claim on authoring the next block of a parathread, although the auction mechanism is beyond the scope of the scheduler. The scheduler guarantees that they'll be given at least a certain number of attempts to author a candidate that is backed. Attempts that fail during the availability phase are not counted, since ensuring availability at that stage is the responsibility of the backing validators, not of the collator. When a claim is accepted, it is placed into a queue of claims, and each claim is assigned to a particular parathread-multiplexing core in advance. Given that the current assignments of validator groups to cores are known, and the upcoming assignments are predictable, it is possible for parathread collators to know who they should be talking to now and how they should begin establishing connections with as a fallback.</p>
<p>With this information, the Node-side can be aware of which parathreads have a good chance of being includable within the relay-chain block and can focus any additional resources on backing candidates from those parathreads. Furthermore, Node-side code is aware of which validator group will be responsible for that thread. If the necessary conditions are reached for core reassignment, those candidates can be backed within the same block as the core being freed.</p>
<p>Parathread claims, when scheduled onto a free core, may not result in a block pending availability. This may be due to collator error, networking timeout, or censorship by the validator group. In this case, the claims should be retried a certain number of times to give the collator a fair shot.</p>

<h2 id="session-change-5"><a class="header" href="#session-change-5">Session Change</a></h2>
<p>Session changes are the only time that configuration can change, and the <a href="runtime/configuration.html">Configuration module</a>'s session-change logic is handled before this module's. We also lean on the behavior of the <a href="runtime/inclusion.html">Inclusion module</a> which clears all its occupied cores on session change. Thus we don't have to worry about cores being occupied across session boundaries and it is safe to re-size the <code>AvailabilityCores</code> bitfield.</p>
<p>Actions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set <code>SessionStartBlock</code> to current block number + 1, as session changes are applied at the end of the block.</li>
<li>Clear all <code>Some</code> members of <code>AvailabilityCores</code>. Return all parathread claims to queue with retries un-incremented.</li>
<li>Set <code>configuration = Configuration::configuration()</code> (see <a href="runtime/../types/runtime.html#host-configuration"><code>HostConfiguration</code></a>)</li>
<li>Fetch <code>Shared::ActiveValidators</code> as AV.</li>
<li>Determine the number of cores &amp; validator groups as <code>n_cores</code>. This is the maximum of
<ol>
<li><code>Paras::parachains().len() + configuration.parathread_cores</code></li>
<li><code>n_validators / max_validators_per_core</code> if <code>configuration.max_validators_per_core</code> is <code>Some</code> and non-zero.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Resize <code>AvailabilityCores</code> to have length <code>n_cores</code> with all <code>None</code> entries.</li>
<li>Compute new validator groups by shuffling using a secure randomness beacon
<ul>
<li>Note that the total number of validators <code>V</code> in AV may not be evenly divided by <code>n_cores</code>.</li>
<li>The groups are selected by partitioning AV.  The first <code>V % N</code> groups will have <code>(V / n_cores) + 1</code> members, while the remaining groups will have <code>(V / N)</code> members each.</li>
<li>Instead of using the indices within AV, which point to the broader set, indices <em>into</em> AV should be used. This implies that groups should have simply ascending validator indices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prune the parathread queue to remove all retries beyond <code>configuration.parathread_retries</code>.
<ul>
<li>Also prune all parathread claims corresponding to de-registered parathreads.</li>
<li>all pruned claims should have their entry removed from the parathread index.</li>
<li>assign all non-pruned claims to new cores if the number of parathread cores has changed between the <code>new_config</code> and <code>old_config</code> of the <code>SessionChangeNotification</code>.</li>
<li>Assign claims in equal balance across all cores if rebalancing, and set the <code>next_core</code> of the <code>ParathreadQueue</code> by incrementing the relative index of the last assigned core and taking it modulo the number of parathread cores. </li>
</ul>

The predicate accepts the index of the core, and the block number since which it has been occupied. The predicate should be implemented based on the time since the last validator group rotation, and the respective parachain and parathread timeouts, i.e. only within <code>max(config.chain_availability_period, config.thread_availability_period)</code> of the last rotation would this return <code>Some</code>.</li>

Returns in <code>ScheduledCore</code> format (todo: link to Runtime APIs page; linkcheck doesn't allow this right now). For parachains, this is always the ID of the parachain and no specified collator. For parathreads, this is based on the next item in the <code>ParathreadQueue</code> assigned to that core, and is <code>None</code> if there isn't one.</li>
<li><code>next_up_on_time_out(CoreIndex) -&gt; Option&lt;ScheduledCore&gt;</code>: Return the next thing that will be scheduled on this core assuming it is currently occupied and the candidate occupying it timed out. Returns in <code>ScheduledCore</code> format (todo: link to Runtime APIs page; linkcheck doesn't allow this right now). For parachains, this is always the ID of the parachain and no specified collator. For parathreads, this is based on the next item in the <code>ParathreadQueue</code> assigned to that core, or if there isn't one, the claim that is currently occupying the core. Otherwise <code>None</code>.</li>
<li><code>clear()</code>:

<p>This module is responsible for providing all data given to the runtime by the block author to the various parachains modules. The entry-point is mandatory, in that it must be invoked exactly once within every block, and it is also &quot;inherent&quot;, in that it is provided with no origin by the block author. The data within it carries its own authentication; i.e. the data takes the form of signed statements by validators. If any of the steps within fails, the entry-point is considered as having failed and the block will be invalid.</p>
<p>This module does not have the same initialization/finalization concerns as the others, as it only requires that entry points be triggered after all modules have initialized and that finalization happens after entry points are triggered. Both of these are assumptions we have already made about the runtime's order of operations, so this module doesn't need to be initialized or finalized by the <code>Initializer</code>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of important notes to the operations in this inherent as they relate to disputes.</p>
<ol>
<li>We don't accept bitfields or backed candidates if in &quot;governance-only&quot; mode from having a local dispute conclude on this fork.</li>
<li>When disputes are initiated, we remove the block from pending availability. This allows us to roll back chains to the block before blocks are included as opposed to backing. It's important to do this before processing bitfields.</li>
<li><code>Inclusion::collect_disputed</code> is kind of expensive so it's important to gate this on whether there are actually any new disputes. Which should be never.</li>
<li>And we don't accept parablocks that have open disputes or disputes that have concluded against the candidate. It's important to import dispute statements before backing, but this is already the case as disputes are imported before processing bitfields.</li>

<p>Runtime APIs are the means by which the node-side code extracts information from the state of the runtime.</p>
<p>Every block in the relay-chain contains a <em>state root</em> which is the root hash of a state trie encapsulating all storage of runtime modules after execution of the block. This is a cryptographic commitment to a unique state. We use the terminology of accessing the <em>state at</em> a block to refer accessing the state referred to by the state root of that block.</p>
<p>Although Runtime APIs are often used for simple storage access, they are actually empowered to do arbitrary computation. The implementation of the Runtime APIs lives within the Runtime as Wasm code and exposes <code>extern</code> functions that can be invoked with arguments and have a return value. Runtime APIs have access to a variety of host functions, which are contextual functions provided by the Wasm execution context, that allow it to carry out many different types of behaviors.</p>
<p>Abilities provided by host functions includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>State Access</li>
<li>Offchain-DB Access</li>
<li>Submitting transactions to the transaction queue</li>
<li>Optimized versions of cryptographic functions</li>
<li>More</li>
</ul>
<p>So it is clear that Runtime APIs are a versatile and powerful tool to leverage the state of the chain. In general, we will use Runtime APIs for these purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access of a storage item</li>
<li>Access of a bundle of related storage items</li>
<li>Deriving a value from storage based on arguments</li>
<li>Submitting misbehavior reports</li>
</ul>
<p>More broadly, we have the goal of using Runtime APIs to write Node-side code that fulfills the requirements set by the Runtime. In particular, the constraints set forth by the <a href="runtime-api/../runtime/scheduler.html">Scheduler</a> and <a href="runtime-api/../runtime/inclusion.html">Inclusion</a> modules. These modules are responsible for advancing paras with a two-phase protocol where validators are first chosen to validate and back a candidate and then required to ensure availability of referenced data. In the second phase, validators are meant to attest to those para-candidates that they have their availability chunk for. As the Node-side code needs to generate the inputs into these two phases, the runtime API needs to transmit information from the runtime that is aware of the Availability Cores model instantiated by the Scheduler and Inclusion modules.</p>
<p>Node-side code is also responsible for detecting and reporting misbehavior performed by other validators, and the set of Runtime APIs needs to provide methods for observing live disputes and submitting reports as transactions.</p>
<p>The next sections will contain information on specific runtime APIs. The format is this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>/// Fetch the value of the runtime API at the block.
///
/// Definitionally, the `at` parameter cannot be any block that is not in the chain.
/// Thus the return value is unconditional. However, for in-practice implementations
/// it may be possible to provide an `at` parameter as a hash, which may not refer to a
/// valid block or one which implements the runtime API. In those cases it would be
/// best for the implementation to return an error indicating the failure mode.
fn some_runtime_api(at: Block, arg1: Type1, arg2: Type2, ...) -&gt; ReturnValue;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Certain runtime APIs concerning the state of a para require the caller to provide an <code>OccupiedCoreAssumption</code>. This indicates how the result of the runtime API should be computed if there is a candidate from the para occupying an availability core in the <a href="runtime-api/../runtime/inclusion.html">Inclusion Module</a>.</p>
<p>The choices of assumption are whether the candidate occupying that core should be assumed to have been made available and included or timed out and discarded, along with a third option to assert that the core was not occupied. This choice affects everything from the parent head-data, the validation code, and the state of message-queues. Typically, users will take the assumption that either the core was free or that the occupying candidate was included, as timeouts are expected only in adversarial circumstances and even so, only in a small minority of blocks directly following validator set rotations.</p>

<p>There are two main runtime APIs to work with PVF pre-checking.</p>
<p>The first runtime API is designed to fetch all PVFs that require pre-checking voting. The PVFs are
identified by their code hashes. As soon as the PVF gains required support, the runtime API will
not return the PVF anymore.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

<p>The second runtime API is needed to submit the judgement for a PVF, whether it is approved or not.
The voting process uses unsigned transactions. The <a href="runtime-api/../types/pvf-prechecking.html"><code>PvfCheckStatement</code></a> is circulated through the network via gossip similar to a normal transaction. At some point the validator
will include the statement in the block, where it will be processed by the runtime. If that was the
last vote before gaining the super-majority, this PVF will not be returned by <code>pvfs_require_precheck</code> anymore.</p>

<h2 id="design-goals"><a class="header" href="#design-goals">Design Goals</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Modularity: Components of the system should be as self-contained as possible. Communication boundaries between components should be well-defined and mockable. This is key to creating testable, easily reviewable code.</li>
<li>Minimizing side effects: Components of the system should aim to minimize side effects and to communicate with other components via message-passing.</li>
<li>Operational Safety: The software will be managing signing keys where conflicting messages can lead to large amounts of value to be slashed. Care should be taken to ensure that no messages are signed incorrectly or in conflict with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>The architecture of the node-side behavior aims to embody the Rust principles of ownership and message-passing to create clean, isolatable code. Each resource should have a single owner, with minimal sharing where unavoidable.</p>
<p>Many operations that need to be carried out involve the network, which is asynchronous. This asynchrony affects all core subsystems that rely on the network as well. The approach of hierarchical state machines is well-suited to this kind of environment.</p>
<p>We introduce</p>
<h2 id="components"><a class="header" href="#components">Components</a></h2>
<p>The node architecture consists of the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Overseer (and subsystems): A hierarchy of state machines where an overseer supervises subsystems. Subsystems can contain their own internal hierarchy of jobs. This is elaborated on in the next section on Subsystems.</li>
<li>A block proposer: Logic triggered by the consensus algorithm of the chain when the node should author a block.</li>
<li>A GRANDPA voting rule: A strategy for selecting chains to vote on in the GRANDPA algorithm to ensure that only valid parachain candidates appear in finalized relay-chain blocks.</li>

<p>The Node-side code comes with a set of assumptions that we build upon. These assumptions encompass most of the fundamental blockchain functionality.</p>
<p>We assume the following constraints regarding provided basic functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>The underlying <strong>consensus</strong> algorithm, whether it is BABE or SASSAFRAS is implemented.</li>
<li>There is a <strong>chain synchronization</strong> protocol which will search for and download the longest available chains at all times.</li>
<li>The <strong>state</strong> of all blocks at the head of the chain is available. There may be <strong>state pruning</strong> such that state of the last <code>k</code> blocks behind the last finalized block are available, as well as the state of all their descendants. This assumption implies that the state of all active leaves and their last <code>k</code> ancestors are all available. The underlying implementation is expected to support <code>k</code> of a few hundred blocks, but we reduce this to a very conservative <code>k=5</code> for our purposes.</li>
<li>There is an underlying <strong>networking</strong> framework which provides <strong>peer discovery</strong> services which will provide us with peers and will not create &quot;loopback&quot; connections to our own node. The number of peers we will have is assumed to be bounded at 1000.</li>
<li>There is a <strong>transaction pool</strong> and a <strong>transaction propagation</strong> mechanism which maintains a set of current transactions and distributes to connected peers. Current transactions are those which are not outdated relative to some &quot;best&quot; fork of the chain, which is part of the active heads, and have not been included in the best fork.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="subsystems-and-jobs"><a class="header" href="#subsystems-and-jobs">Subsystems and Jobs</a></h1>
<p>In this section we define the notions of Subsystems and Jobs. These are guidelines for how we will employ an architecture of hierarchical state machines. We'll have a top-level state machine which oversees the next level of state machines which oversee another layer of state machines and so on. The next sections will lay out these guidelines for what we've called subsystems and jobs, since this model applies to many of the tasks that the Node-side behavior needs to encompass, but these are only guidelines and some Subsystems may have deeper hierarchies internally.</p>
<p>Subsystems are long-lived worker tasks that are in charge of performing some particular kind of work. All subsystems can communicate with each other via a well-defined protocol. Subsystems can't generally communicate directly, but must coordinate communication through an <a href="node/overseer.html">Overseer</a>, which is responsible for relaying messages, handling subsystem failures, and dispatching work signals.</p>
<p>Most work that happens on the Node-side is related to building on top of a specific relay-chain block, which is contextually known as the &quot;relay parent&quot;. We call it the relay parent to explicitly denote that it is a block in the relay chain and not on a parachain. We refer to the parent because when we are in the process of building a new block, we don't know what that new block is going to be. The parent block is our only stable point of reference, even though it is usually only useful when it is not yet a parent but in fact a leaf of the block-DAG expected to soon become a parent (because validators are authoring on top of it). Furthermore, we are assuming a forkful blockchain-extension protocol, which means that there may be multiple possible children of the relay-parent. Even if the relay parent has multiple children blocks, the parent of those children is the same, and the context in which those children is authored should be the same. The parent block is the best and most stable reference to use for defining the scope of work items and messages, and is typically referred to by its cryptographic hash.</p>
<p>Since this goal of determining when to start and conclude work relative to a specific relay-parent is common to most, if not all subsystems, it is logically the job of the Overseer to distribute those signals as opposed to each subsystem duplicating that effort, potentially being out of synchronization with each other. Subsystem A should be able to expect that subsystem B is working on the same relay-parents as it is. One of the Overseer's tasks is to provide this heartbeat, or synchronized rhythm, to the system.</p>
<p>The work that subsystems spawn to be done on a specific relay-parent is known as a job. Subsystems should set up and tear down jobs according to the signals received from the overseer. Subsystems may share or cache state between jobs.</p>
<p>Subsystems must be robust to spurious exits. The outputs of the set of subsystems as a whole comprises of signed messages and data committed to disk. Care must be taken to avoid issuing messages that are not substantiated. Since subsystems need to be safe under spurious exits, it is the expected behavior that an <code>OverseerSignal::Conclude</code> can just lead to breaking the loop and exiting directly as opposed to waiting for everything to shut down gracefully.</p>
<h2 id="subsystem-message-traffic"><a class="header" href="#subsystem-message-traffic">Subsystem Message Traffic</a></h2>
<p>Which subsystems send messages to which other subsystems.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This diagram omits the overseer for simplicity. In fact, all messages are relayed via the overseer.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Messages with a filled diamond arrowhead (&quot;♦&quot;) include a <code>oneshot::Sender</code> which communicates a response from the recipient.
Messages with an open triangle arrowhead (&quot;Δ&quot;) do not include a return sender.</p>

<p>Let's contextualize that diagram a bit by following a parachain block from its creation through finalization.
Parachains can use completely arbitrary processes to generate blocks. The relay chain doesn't know or care about
the details; each parachain just needs to provide a <a href="node/collators/collation-generation.html">collator</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Inter-subsystem communications are relayed via the overseer, but that step is omitted here for brevity.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Dashed lines indicate a request/response cycle, where the response is communicated asynchronously via
a oneshot channel. Adjacent dashed lines may be processed in parallel.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram

    end
</pre>
<p>The <code>DistributeCollation</code> messages that <code>CollationGeneration</code> sends to the <code>CollatorProtocol</code> contains
two items: a <code>CandidateReceipt</code> and <code>PoV</code>. The <code>CollatorProtocol</code> is then responsible for distributing
that collation to interested validators. However, not all potential collations are of interest. The
<code>CandidateSelection</code> subsystem is responsible for determining which collations are interesting, before
<code>CollatorProtocol</code> actually fetches the collation.</p>

    CS -&gt;&gt; NB: AdvertiseCollation
    NB -&gt;&gt; VS: AdvertiseCollation

    VS -&gt;&gt; CandidateSelection: Collation

    Note over CandidateSelection: Lots of other machinery in play here,&lt;br/&gt;but there are only three outcomes from the&lt;br/&gt;perspective of the `CollatorProtocol`:

    alt happy path
        CandidateSelection --&gt;&gt; VS: FetchCollation
        Activate VS
        VS -&gt;&gt; NB: RequestCollation
        NB -&gt;&gt; CS: RequestCollation

        VS -&gt;&gt; NB: ReportPeer

    else CandidateSelection already selected a different candidate
        Note over CandidateSelection: silently drop
    end
</pre>
<p>Assuming we hit the happy path, flow continues with <code>CandidateSelection</code> receiving a <code>(candidate_receipt, pov)</code> as
the return value from its
<code>FetchCollation</code> request. The only time <code>CandidateSelection</code> actively requests a collation is when
it hasn't yet seconded one for some <code>relay_parent</code>, and is ready to second.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram

    % fn validate_and_make_available
    CB --&gt;&gt; CV: ValidateFromChainState

    Note over CB,CV: There's some complication in the source, as&lt;br/&gt;candidates are actually validated in a separate task.

    alt valid
        Note over CB: This is where we transform the CandidateReceipt into a CommittedCandidateReceipt
        % CandidateBackingJob::sign_import_and_distribute_statement
        % CandidateBackingJob::import_statement
        CB -&gt;&gt; PV: ProvisionableData::BackedCandidate
        % CandidateBackingJob::issue_new_misbehaviors
        opt if there is misbehavior to report
            CB -&gt;&gt; PV: ProvisionableData::MisbehaviorReport
        end

    else invalid
        CB -&gt;&gt; CS: Invalid
    end
</pre>
<p>At this point, you'll see that control flows in two directions: to <code>StatementDistribution</code> to distribute
the <code>SignedStatement</code>, and to <code>PoVDistribution</code> to distribute the <code>PoV</code>. However, that's largely a mirage:
while the initial implementation distributes <code>PoV</code>s by gossip, that's inefficient, and will be replaced
with a system which fetches <code>PoV</code>s only when actually necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: figure out more precisely the current status and plans; write them up</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, we'll follow the <code>SignedStatement</code>. The <code>StatementDistribution</code> subsystem is largely concerned
with implementing a gossip protocol:</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram
    participant SD as StatementDistribution
    participant NB as NetworkBridge

    alt On receipt of a&lt;br/&gt;SignedStatement from CandidateBacking
        % fn circulate_statement_and_dependents
        SD -&gt;&gt; NB: SendValidationMessage

        Note right of NB: Bridge sends validation message to all appropriate peers
    else On receipt of peer validation message
        NB -&gt;&gt; SD: NetworkBridgeUpdate

        % fn handle_incoming_message
        alt if we aren't already aware of the relay parent for this statement
            SD -&gt;&gt; NB: ReportPeer
        end

        % fn circulate_statement
        opt if we know of peers who haven't seen this message, gossip it
            SD -&gt;&gt; NB: SendValidationMessage
        end
    end
</pre>
<p>But who are these <code>Listener</code>s who've asked to be notified about incoming <code>SignedStatement</code>s?
Nobody, as yet.</p>
<p>Let's pick back up with the PoV Distribution subsystem.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram

    loop for each Listener
        PD -&gt;&gt; Listener: Arc&lt;PoV&gt;
    end

    Note over PD,NB: On receipt of a network PoV, PovDistribution forwards it to each Listener.&lt;br/&gt;It also penalizes bad gossipers.
</pre>
<p>Unlike in the case of <code>StatementDistribution</code>, there is another subsystem which in various circumstances
already registers a listener to be notified when a new <code>PoV</code> arrives: <code>CandidateBacking</code>. Note that this
is the second time that <code>CandidateBacking</code> has gotten involved. The first instance was from the perspective
of the validator choosing to second a candidate via its <code>CandidateSelection</code> subsystem. This time, it's
from the perspective of some other validator, being informed that this foreign <code>PoV</code> has been received.</p>

<p>At this point, things have gone a bit nonlinear. Let's pick up the thread again with <code>BitfieldSigning</code>. As
the <code>Overseer</code> activates each relay parent, it starts a <code>BitfieldSigningJob</code> which operates on an extremely
simple metric: after creation, it immediately goes to sleep for 1.5 seconds. On waking, it records the state
of the world pertaining to availability at that moment.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram

        end
        BS -&gt;&gt; BD: DistributeBitfield
    end
</pre>
<p><code>BitfieldDistribution</code> is, like the other <code>*Distribution</code> subsystems, primarily interested in implementing
a peer-to-peer gossip network propagating its particular messages. However, it also serves as an essential
relay passing the message along.</p>
<pre class="mermaid">sequenceDiagram

</pre>
<p>We've now seen the message flow to the <code>Provisioner</code>: both <code>CandidateBacking</code> and <code>BitfieldDistribution</code>
contribute provisionable data. Now, let's look at that subsystem.</p>
<p>Much like the <code>BitfieldSigning</code> subsystem, the <code>Provisioner</code> creates a new job for each newly-activated
leaf, and starts a timer. Unlike <code>BitfieldSigning</code>, we won't depict that part of the process, because
the <code>Provisioner</code> also has other things going on.</p>

        end
    end
</pre>
<p>In principle, any arbitrary subsystem could send a <code>RequestInherentData</code> to the <code>Provisioner</code>. In practice,
only the <code>ParachainsInherentDataProvider</code> does so.</p>
<p>The tuple <code>(SignedAvailabilityBitfields, BackedCandidates, ParentHeader)</code> is injected by the <code>ParachainsInherentDataProvider</code>
into the inherent data. From that point on, control passes from the node to the runtime.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The overseer determines work to do based on block import events and block finalization events. It does this by keeping track of the set of relay-parents for which work is currently being done. This is known as the &quot;active leaves&quot; set. It determines an initial set of active leaves on startup based on the data on-disk, and uses events about blockchain import to update the active leaves. Updates lead to <a href="node/../types/overseer-protocol.html#overseer-signal"><code>OverseerSignal</code></a><code>::ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> being sent according to new relay-parents, as well as relay-parents to stop considering. Block import events inform the overseer of leaves that no longer need to be built on, now that they have children, and inform us to begin building on those children. Block finalization events inform us when we can stop focusing on blocks that appear to have been orphaned.</p>
<p>The overseer is also responsible for tracking the freshness of active leaves. Leaves are fresh when they're encountered for the first time, and stale when they're encountered for subsequent times. This can occur after chain reversions or when the fork-choice rule abandons some chain. This distinction is used to manage <strong>Reversion Safety</strong>. Consensus messages are often localized to a specific relay-parent, and it is often a misbehavior to equivocate or sign two conflicting messages. When reverting the chain, we may begin work on a leaf that subsystems have already signed messages for. Subsystems which need to account for reversion safety should avoid performing work on stale leaves.</p>
<p>The overseer's logic can be described with these functions:</p>
<h2 id="on-startup"><a class="header" href="#on-startup">On Startup</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Start all subsystems</li>
<li>Determine all blocks of the blockchain that should be built on. This should typically be the head of the best fork of the chain we are aware of. Sometimes add recent forks as well.</li>
<li>Send an <code>OverseerSignal::ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> to all subsystems with <code>activated</code> containing each of these blocks.</li>
<li>Begin listening for block import and finality events</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="on-block-import-event"><a class="header" href="#on-block-import-event">On Block Import Event</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Apply the block import event to the active leaves. A new block should lead to its addition to the active leaves set and its parent being deactivated.</li>
<li>Mark any stale leaves as stale. The overseer should track all leaves it activates to determine whether leaves are fresh or stale.</li>
<li>Send an <code>OverseerSignal::ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message to all subsystems containing all activated and deactivated leaves.</li>
<li>Ensure all <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> messages are flushed before resuming activity as a message router.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: in the future, we may want to avoid building on too many sibling blocks at once. the notion of a &quot;preferred head&quot; among many competing sibling blocks would imply changes in our &quot;active leaves&quot; update rules here</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="on-finalization-event"><a class="header" href="#on-finalization-event">On Finalization Event</a></h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="on-subsystem-failure"><a class="header" href="#on-subsystem-failure">On Subsystem Failure</a></h2>
<p>Subsystems are essential tasks meant to run as long as the node does. Subsystems can spawn ephemeral work in the form of jobs, but the subsystems themselves should not go down. If a subsystem goes down, it will be because of a critical error that should take the entire node down as well.</p>
<h2 id="communication-between-subsystems"><a class="header" href="#communication-between-subsystems">Communication Between Subsystems</a></h2>
<p>When a subsystem wants to communicate with another subsystem, or, more typically, a job within a subsystem wants to communicate with its counterpart under another subsystem, that communication must happen via the overseer. Consider this example where a job on subsystem A wants to send a message to its counterpart under subsystem B. This is a realistic scenario, where you can imagine that both jobs correspond to work under the same relay-parent.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>First, the subsystem that spawned a job is responsible for handling the first step of the communication. The overseer is not aware of the hierarchy of tasks within any given subsystem and is only responsible for subsystem-to-subsystem communication. So the sending subsystem must pass on the message via the overseer to the receiving subsystem, in such a way that the receiving subsystem can further address the communication to one of its internal tasks, if necessary.</p>
<p>This communication prevents a certain class of race conditions. When the Overseer determines that it is time for subsystems to begin working on top of a particular relay-parent, it will dispatch a <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message to all subsystems to do so, and those messages will be handled asynchronously by those subsystems. Some subsystems will receive those messsages before others, and it is important that a message sent by subsystem A after receiving <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message will arrive at subsystem B after its <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message. If subsystem A maintained an independent channel with subsystem B to communicate, it would be possible for subsystem B to handle the side message before the <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message, but it wouldn't have any logical course of action to take with the side message - leading to it being discarded or improperly handled. Well-architectured state machines should have a single source of inputs, so that is what we do here.</p>
<p>One exception is reasonable to make for responses to requests. A request should be made via the overseer in order to ensure that it arrives after any relevant <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message. A subsystem issuing a request as a result of a <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message can safely receive the response via a side-channel for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's impossible for a request to be answered before it arrives, it is provable that any response to a request obeys the same ordering constraint.</li>
<li>The request was sent as a result of handling a <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message. Then there is no possible future in which the <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> message has not been handled upon the receipt of the response.</li>
</ol>
<p>So as a single exception to the rule that all communication must happen via the overseer we allow the receipt of responses to requests via a side-channel, which may be established for that purpose. This simplifies any cases where the outside world desires to make a request to a subsystem, as the outside world can then establish a side-channel to receive the response on.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the overseer is not aware of the internals of subsystems, and this extends to the jobs that they spawn. The overseer isn't aware of the existence or definition of those jobs, and is only aware of the outer subsystems with which it interacts. This gives subsystem implementations leeway to define internal jobs as they see fit, and to wrap a more complex hierarchy of state machines than having a single layer of jobs for relay-parent-based work. Likewise, subsystems aren't required to spawn jobs. Certain types of subsystems, such as those for shared storage or networking resources, won't perform block-based work but would still benefit from being on the Overseer's message bus. These subsystems can just ignore the overseer's signals for block-based work.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the protocols by which subsystems communicate with each other should be well-defined irrespective of the implementation of the subsystem. In other words, their interface should be distinct from their implementation. This will prevent subsystems from accessing aspects of each other that are beyond the scope of the communication boundary.</p>

<p>Specifics on the motivation and types of constraints we apply to the GRANDPA voting logic as well as the definitions of <strong>viable</strong> and <strong>finalizable</strong> blocks can be found in the <a href="node/../protocol-chain-selection.html">Chain Selection Protocol</a> section.
The subsystem which provides us with viable leaves is the <a href="node/utility/chain-selection.html">Chain Selection Subsystem</a>. </p>
<p>GRANDPA's regular voting rule is for each validator to select the longest chain they are aware of. GRANDPA proceeds in rounds, collecting information from all online validators and determines the blocks that a supermajority of validators all have in common with each other.</p>
<p>The low-level GRANDPA logic will provide us with a <strong>required block</strong>. We can find the best leaf containing that block in its chain with the <a href="node/../types/overseer-protocol.html#chain-selection-message"><code>ChainSelectionMessage::BestLeafContaining</code></a>. If the result is <code>None</code>, then we will simply cast a vote on the required block.</p>
<p>The <strong>viable</strong> leaves provided from the chain selection subsystem are not necessarily <strong>finalizable</strong>, so we need to perform further work to discover the finalizable ancestor of the block. The first constraint is to avoid voting on any unapproved block. The highest approved ancestor of a given block can be determined by querying the Approval Voting subsystem via the <a href="node/../types/overseer-protocol.html#approval-voting"><code>ApprovalVotingMessage::ApprovedAncestor</code></a> message. If the response is <code>Some</code>, we continue and apply the second constraint. The second constraint is to avoid voting on any block containing a candidate undergoing an active dispute. The list of block hashes and candidates returned from <code>ApprovedAncestor</code> should be reversed, and passed to the <a href="node/../types/overseer-protocol.html#dispute-coordinator-message"><code>DisputeCoordinatorMessage::DetermineUndisputedChain</code></a> to determine the <strong>finalizable</strong> block which will be our eventual vote.</p>

<p>The Collator Protocol implements the network protocol by which collators and validators communicate. It is used by collators to distribute collations to validators and used by validators to accept collations by collators.</p>
<p>Collator-to-Validator networking is more difficult than Validator-to-Validator networking because the set of possible collators for any given para is unbounded, unlike the validator set. Validator-to-Validator networking protocols can easily be implemented as gossip because the data can be bounded, and validators can authenticate each other by their <code>PeerId</code>s for the purposes of instantiating and accepting connections.</p>
<p>Since, at least at the level of the para abstraction, the collator-set for any given para is unbounded, validators need to make sure that they are receiving connections from capable and honest collators and that their bandwidth and time are not being wasted by attackers. Communicating across this trust-boundary is the most difficult part of this subsystem.</p>
<p>Validation of candidates is a heavy task, and furthermore, the <a href="node/collators/../../types/availability.html#proofofvalidity"><code>PoV</code></a> itself is a large piece of data. Empirically, <code>PoV</code>s are on the order of 10MB.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: note the incremental validation function Ximin proposes at https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/1348</p>

<p>As this network protocol serves as a bridge between collators and validators, it communicates primarily with one subsystem on behalf of each. As a collator, this will receive messages from the <a href="node/collators/collation-generation.html"><code>CollationGeneration</code></a> subsystem. As a validator, this will communicate only with the <a href="node/collators/../backing/candidate-backing.html"><code>CandidateBacking</code></a>.</p>

<h3 id="collators-1"><a class="header" href="#collators-1">Collators</a></h3>
<p>It is assumed that collators are only collating on a single parachain. Collations are generated by the <a href="node/collators/collation-generation.html">Collation Generation</a> subsystem. We will keep up to one local collation per relay-parent, based on <code>DistributeCollation</code> messages. If the para is not scheduled on any core, at the relay-parent, or the relay-parent isn't in the active-leaves set, we ignore the message as it must be invalid in that case - although this indicates a logic error elsewhere in the node.</p>
<p>We keep track of the Para ID we are collating on as a collator. This starts as <code>None</code>, and is updated with each <code>CollateOn</code> message received. If the <code>ParaId</code> of a collation requested to be distributed does not match the one we expect, we ignore the message.</p>
<p>As with most other subsystems, we track the active leaves set by following <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> signals.</p>
<p>For the purposes of actually distributing a collation, we need to be connected to the validators who are interested in collations on that <code>ParaId</code> at this point in time. We assume that there is a discovery API for connecting to a set of validators.</p>
<p>As seen in the <a href="node/collators/../../runtime/scheduler.html">Scheduler Module</a> of the runtime, validator groups are fixed for an entire session and their rotations across cores are predictable. Collators will want to do these things when attempting to distribute collations at a given relay-parent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine which core the para collated-on is assigned to.</li>
<li>Determine the group on that core.</li>
<li>Issue a discovery request for the validators of the current group with<a href="node/collators/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#network-bridge-message"><code>NetworkBridgeMessage</code></a><code>::ConnectToValidators</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once connected to the relevant peers for the current group assigned to the core (transitively, the para), advertise the collation to any of them which advertise the relay-parent in their view (as provided by the <a href="node/collators/../utility/network-bridge.html">Network Bridge</a>). If any respond with a request for the full collation, provide it. However, we only send one collation at a time per relay parent, other requests need to wait. This is done to reduce the bandwidth requirements of a collator and also increases the chance to fully send the collation to at least one validator. From the point where one validator has received the collation and seconded it, it will also start to share this collation with other validators in its backing group. Upon receiving a view update from any of these peers which includes a relay-parent for which we have a collation that they will find relevant, advertise the collation to them if we haven't already.</p>
<h3 id="validators-1"><a class="header" href="#validators-1">Validators</a></h3>
<p>On the validator side of the protocol, validators need to accept incoming connections from collators. They should keep some peer slots open for accepting new speculative connections from collators and should disconnect from collators who are not relevant.</p>

<p>When peers connect to us, they can <code>Declare</code> that they represent a collator with given public key and intend to collate on a specific para ID. Once they've declared that, and we checked their signature, they can begin to send advertisements of collations. The peers should not send us any advertisements for collations that are on a relay-parent outside of our view or for a para outside of the one they've declared.</p>
<p>The protocol tracks advertisements received and the source of the advertisement. The advertisement source is the <code>PeerId</code> of the peer who sent the message. We accept one advertisement per collator per source per relay-parent.</p>
<p>As a validator, we will handle requests from other subsystems to fetch a collation on a specific <code>ParaId</code> and relay-parent. These requests are made with the request response protocol <code>CollationFetchingRequest</code> request. To do so, we need to first check if we have already gathered a collation on that <code>ParaId</code> and relay-parent. If not, we need to select one of the advertisements and issue a request for it. If we've already issued a request, we shouldn't issue another one until the first has returned.</p>
<p>When acting on an advertisement, we issue a <code>Requests::CollationFetchingV1</code>. However, we only request one collation at a time per relay parent. This reduces the bandwidth requirements and as we can second only one candidate per relay parent, the others are probably not required anyway. If the request times out, we need to note the collator as being unreliable and reduce its priority relative to other collators.</p>
<p>As a validator, once the collation has been fetched some other subsystem will inspect and do deeper validation of the collation. The subsystem will report to this subsystem with a <a href="node/collators/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#collator-protocol-message"><code>CollatorProtocolMessage</code></a><code>::ReportCollator</code>. In that case, if we are connected directly to the collator, we apply a cost to the <code>PeerId</code> associated with the collator and potentially disconnect or blacklist it. If the collation is seconded, we notify the collator and apply a benefit to the <code>PeerId</code> associated with the collator.</p>
<h3 id="interaction-with-candidate-backing"><a class="header" href="#interaction-with-candidate-backing">Interaction with <a href="node/collators/../backing/candidate-backing.html">Candidate Backing</a></a></h3>
<p>As collators advertise the availability, a validator will simply second the first valid parablock candidate per relay head by sending a <a href="node/collators/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#candidate-backing-mesage"><code>CandidateBackingMessage</code></a><code>::Second</code>. Note that this message contains the relay parent of the advertised collation, the candidate receipt and the <a href="node/collators/../../types/availability.html#proofofvalidity">PoV</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, once a valid parablock candidate has been seconded, the <a href="node/collators/../backing/candidate-backing.html"><code>CandidateBacking</code></a> subsystem will send a <a href="node/collators/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#collator-protocol-message"><code>CollatorProtocolMessage</code></a><code>::Seconded</code>, which will trigger this subsystem to notify the collator at the <code>PeerId</code> that first advertised the parablock on the seconded relay head of their successful seconding.</p>
<h2 id="future-work-1"><a class="header" href="#future-work-1">Future Work</a></h2>
<p>Several approaches have been discussed, but all have some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current approach is very straightforward. However, that protocol is vulnerable to a single collator which, as an attack or simply through chance, gets its block candidate to the node more often than its fair share of the time.</li>
<li>If collators produce blocks via Aura, BABE or in future Sassafras, it may be possible to choose an &quot;Official&quot; collator for the round, but it may be tricky to ensure that the PVF logic is enforced at collator leader election.</li>
<li>We could use relay-chain BABE randomness to generate some delay <code>D</code> on the order of 1 second, +- 1 second. The collator would then second the first valid parablock which arrives after <code>D</code>, or in case none has arrived by <code>2*D</code>, the last valid parablock which has arrived. This makes it very hard for a collator to game the system to always get its block nominated, but it reduces the maximum throughput of the system by introducing delay into an already tight schedule.</li>
<li>A variation of that scheme would be to have a fixed acceptance window <code>D</code> for parablock candidates and keep track of count <code>C</code>: the number of parablock candidates received. At the end of the period <code>D</code>, we choose a random number I in the range <code>[0, C)</code> and second the block at Index I. Its drawback is the same: it must wait the full <code>D</code> period before seconding any of its received candidates, reducing throughput.</li>
<li>In order to protect against DoS attacks, it may be prudent to run throw out collations from collators that have behaved poorly (whether recently or historically) and subsequently only verify the PoV for the most suitable of collations.</li>
</ul>
<footer id="last-change">Last change: %cs, commit: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/commit/4ddf0ffe5b">4ddf0ffe5b</a></footer><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="backing-subsystems"><a class="header" href="#backing-subsystems">Backing Subsystems</a></h1>
<p>The backing subsystems, when conceived as a black box, receive an arbitrary quantity of parablock candidates and associated proofs of validity from arbitrary untrusted collators. From these, they produce a bounded quantity of backable candidates which relay chain block authors may choose to include in a subsequent block.</p>
<p>In broad strokes, the flow operates like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Candidate Selection</strong> winnows the field of parablock candidates, selecting up to one of them to second.</li>
<li><strong>Candidate Backing</strong> ensures that a seconding candidate is valid, then generates the appropriate <code>Statement</code>. It also keeps track of which candidates have received the backing of a quorum of other validators.</li>
<li><strong>Statement Distribution</strong> is the networking component which ensures that all validators receive each others' statements.</li>
<li><strong>PoV Distribution</strong> is the networking component which ensures that validators considering a candidate can get the appropriate PoV.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="candidate-backing"><a class="header" href="#candidate-backing">Candidate Backing</a></h1>
<p>The Candidate Backing subsystem ensures every parablock considered for relay block inclusion has been seconded by at least one validator, and approved by a quorum. Parablocks for which not enough validators will assert correctness are discarded. If the block later proves invalid, the initial backers are slashable; this gives polkadot a rational threat model during subsequent stages.</p>
<p>Its role is to produce backable candidates for inclusion in new relay-chain blocks. It does so by issuing signed <a href="node/backing/../../types/backing.html#statement-type"><code>Statement</code>s</a> and tracking received statements signed by other validators. Once enough statements are received, they can be combined into backing for specific candidates.</p>
<p>Note that though the candidate backing subsystem attempts to produce as many backable candidates as possible, it does <em>not</em> attempt to choose a single authoritative one. The choice of which actually gets included is ultimately up to the block author, by whatever metrics it may use; those are opaque to this subsystem.</p>
<p>Once a sufficient quorum has agreed that a candidate is valid, this subsystem notifies the <a href="node/backing/../utility/provisioner.html">Provisioner</a>, which in turn engages block production mechanisms to include the parablock.</p>

This is done via signed <a href="node/backing/../../types/backing.html#statement-type"><code>Statement</code>s</a> by validators. If a candidate receives a majority of supporting Statements from the Parachain Validators currently assigned, then that candidate is considered backable.</p>

<p>Implemented as a gossip protocol. Handle updates to our view and peers' views. Neighbor packets are used to inform peers which chain heads we are interested in data for.</p>
<p>It is responsible for distributing signed statements that we have generated and forwarding them, and for detecting a variety of Validator misbehaviors for reporting to <a href="node/backing/../utility/misbehavior-arbitration.html">Misbehavior Arbitration</a>. During the Backing stage of the inclusion pipeline, it's the main point of contact with peer nodes. On receiving a signed statement from a peer in the same backing group, assuming the peer receipt state machine is in an appropriate state, it sends the Candidate Receipt to the <a href="node/backing/candidate-backing.html">Candidate Backing subsystem</a> to handle the validator's statement. On receiving <code>StatementDistributionMessage::Share</code> we make sure to send messages to our backing group in addition to random other peers, to ensure a fast backing process and getting all statements quickly for distribution.</p>
<p>Track equivocating validators and stop accepting information from them. Establish a data-dependency order:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to receive a <code>Seconded</code> message we have the corresponding chain head in our view</li>
<li>In order to receive an <code>Valid</code> message we must have received the corresponding <code>Seconded</code> message.</li>
</ul>
<p>And respect this data-dependency order from our peers by respecting their views. This subsystem is responsible for checking message signatures.</p>
<p>The Statement Distribution subsystem sends statements to peer nodes.</p>
<h2 id="peer-receipt-state-machine"><a class="header" href="#peer-receipt-state-machine">Peer Receipt State Machine</a></h2>
<p>There is a very simple state machine which governs which messages we are willing to receive from peers. Not depicted in the state machine: on initial receipt of any <a href="node/backing/../../types/backing.html#signed-statement-type"><code>SignedFullStatement</code></a>, validate that the provided signature does in fact sign the included data. Note that each individual parablock candidate gets its own instance of this state machine; it is perfectly legal to receive a <code>Valid(X)</code> before a <code>Seconded(Y)</code>, as long as a <code>Seconded(X)</code> has been received.</p>
<p>A: Initial State. Receive <code>SignedFullStatement(Statement::Second)</code>: extract <code>Statement</code>, forward to Candidate Backing, proceed to B. Receive any other <code>SignedFullStatement</code> variant: drop it.</p>
<p>B: Receive any <code>SignedFullStatement</code>: check signature and determine whether the statement is new to us. if new, forward to Candidate Backing and circulate to other peers. Receive <code>OverseerMessage::StopWork</code>: proceed to C.</p>
<p>C: Receive any message for this block: drop it.</p>
<p>For large statements (see below), we also keep track of the total received large
statements per peer and have a hard limit on that number for flood protection.
This is necessary as in the current code we only forward statements once we have
all the data, therefore flood protection for large statement is a bit more
subtle. This will become an obsolete problem once <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/2979">off chain code
upgrades</a> are implemented.</p>
<h2 id="peer-knowledge-tracking"><a class="header" href="#peer-knowledge-tracking">Peer Knowledge Tracking</a></h2>
<p>The peer receipt state machine implies that for parsimony of network resources, we should model the knowledge of our peers, and help them out. For example, let's consider a case with peers A, B, and C, validators X and Y, and candidate M. A sends us a <code>Statement::Second(M)</code> signed by X. We've double-checked it, and it's valid. While we're checking it, we receive a copy of X's <code>Statement::Second(M)</code> from <code>B</code>, along with a <code>Statement::Valid(M)</code> signed by Y.</p>
<p>Our response to A is just the <code>Statement::Valid(M)</code> signed by Y. However, we haven't heard anything about this from C. Therefore, we send it everything we have: first a copy of X's <code>Statement::Second</code>, then Y's <code>Statement::Valid</code>.</p>
<p>This system implies a certain level of duplication of messages--we received X's <code>Statement::Second</code> from both our peers, and C may experience the same--but it minimizes the degree to which messages are simply dropped.</p>
<p>And respect this data-dependency order from our peers. This subsystem is responsible for checking message signatures.</p>
<p>No jobs. We follow view changes from the <a href="node/backing/../utility/network-bridge.html"><code>NetworkBridge</code></a>, which in turn is updated by the overseer.</p>
<h2 id="equivocations-and-flood-protection"><a class="header" href="#equivocations-and-flood-protection">Equivocations and Flood Protection</a></h2>
<p>An equivocation is a double-vote by a validator. The <a href="node/backing/candidate-backing.html">Candidate Backing</a> Subsystem is better-suited than this one to detect equivocations as it adds votes to quorum trackers.</p>
<p>At this level, we are primarily concerned about flood-protection, and to some extent, detecting equivocations is a part of that. In particular, we are interested in detecting equivocations of <code>Seconded</code> statements. Since every other statement is dependent on <code>Seconded</code> statements, ensuring that we only ever hold a bounded number of <code>Seconded</code> statements is sufficient for flood-protection.</p>
<p>The simple approach is to say that we only receive up to two <code>Seconded</code> statements per validator per chain head. However, the marginal cost of equivocation, conditional on having already equivocated, is close to 0, since a single double-vote offence is counted as all double-vote offences for a particular chain-head. Even if it were not, there is some amount of equivocations that can be done such that the marginal cost of issuing further equivocations is close to 0, as there would be an amount of equivocations necessary to be completely and totally obliterated by the slashing algorithm. We fear the validator with nothing left to lose.</p>
<p>With that in mind, this simple approach has a caveat worth digging deeper into.</p>
<p>First: We may be aware of two equivocated <code>Seconded</code> statements issued by a validator. A totally honest peer of ours can also be aware of one or two different <code>Seconded</code> statements issued by the same validator. And yet another peer may be aware of one or two <em>more</em> <code>Seconded</code> statements. And so on. This interacts badly with pre-emptive sending logic. Upon sending a <code>Seconded</code> statement to a peer, we will want to pre-emptively follow up with all statements relative to that candidate. Waiting for acknowledgment introduces latency at every hop, so that is best avoided. What can happen is that upon receipt of the <code>Seconded</code> statement, the peer will discard it as it falls beyond the bound of 2 that it is allowed to store. It cannot store anything in memory about discarded candidates as that would introduce a DoS vector. Then, the peer would receive from us all of the statements pertaining to that candidate, which, from its perspective, would be undesired - they are data-dependent on the <code>Seconded</code> statement we sent them, but they have erased all record of that from their memory. Upon receiving a potential flood of undesired statements, this 100% honest peer may choose to disconnect from us. In this way, an adversary may be able to partition the network with careful distribution of equivocated <code>Seconded</code> statements.</p>
<p>The fix is to track, per-peer, the hashes of up to 4 candidates per validator (per relay-parent) that the peer is aware of. It is 4 because we may send them 2 and they may send us 2 different ones. We track the data that they are aware of as the union of things we have sent them and things they have sent us. If we receive a 1st or 2nd <code>Seconded</code> statement from a peer, we note it in the peer's known candidates even if we do disregard the data locally. And then, upon receipt of any data dependent on that statement, we do not reduce that peer's standing in our eyes, as the data was not undesired.</p>
<p>There is another caveat to the fix: we don't want to allow the peer to flood us because it has set things up in a way that it knows we will drop all of its traffic.
We also track how many statements we have received per peer, per candidate, and per chain-head. This is any statement concerning a particular candidate: <code>Seconded</code>, <code>Valid</code>, or <code>Invalid</code>. If we ever receive a statement from a peer which would push any of these counters beyond twice the amount of validators at the chain-head, we begin to lower the peer's standing and eventually disconnect. This bound is a massive overestimate and could be reduced to twice the number of validators in the corresponding validator group. It is worth noting that the goal at the time of writing is to ensure any finite bound on the amount of stored data, as any equivocation results in a large slash.</p>
<h2 id="large-statements"><a class="header" href="#large-statements">Large statements</a></h2>
<p>Seconded statements can become quite large on parachain runtime upgrades for
example. For this reason, there exists a <code>LargeStatement</code> constructor for the
<code>StatementDistributionMessage</code> wire message, which only contains light metadata
of a statement. The actual candidate data is not included. This message type is
used whenever a message is deemed large. The receiver of such a message needs to
request the actual payload via request/response by means of a
<code>StatementFetchingV1</code> request.</p>
<p>This is necessary as distribution of a large payload (mega bytes) via gossip
would make the network collapse and timely distribution of statements would no
longer be possible. By using request/response it is ensured that each peer only
transferes large data once. We only take good care to detect an overloaded
peer early and immediately move on to a different peer for fetching the data.
This mechanism should result in a good load distribution and therefore a rather
optimal distribution path.</p>
<p>With these optimizations, distribution of payloads in the size of up to 3 to 4
MB should work with Kusama validator specifications. For scaling up even more,
runtime upgrades and message passing should be done off chain at some point.</p>
<p>Flood protection considerations: For making DoS attacks slightly harder on this
subsystem, nodes will only respond to large statement requests, when they
previously notified that peer via gossip about that statement. So, it is not
possible to DoS nodes at scale, by requesting candidate data over and over
again.</p>

<p>The availability subsystems are responsible for ensuring that Proofs of Validity of backed candidates are widely available within the validator set, without requiring every node to retain a full copy. They accomplish this by broadly distributing erasure-coded chunks of the PoV, keeping track of which validator has which chunk by means of signed bitfields. They are also responsible for reassembling a complete PoV when required, e.g. when a fisherman reports a potentially invalid block.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="availability-distribution"><a class="header" href="#availability-distribution">Availability Distribution</a></h1>
<p>This subsystem is responsible for distribution availability data to peers.
Availability data are chunks, <code>PoV</code>s and <code>AvailableData</code> (which is <code>PoV</code> +
<code>PersistedValidationData</code>). It does so via request response protocols.</p>
<p>In particular this subsystem is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respond to network requests requesting availability data by querying the
<a href="node/availability/../utility/availability-store.html">Availability Store</a>.</li>
<li>Request chunks from backing validators to put them in the local <code>Availability Store</code> whenever we find an occupied core on any fresh leaf,
this is to ensure availability by at least 2/3+ of all validators, this
happens after a candidate is backed.</li>
<li>Fetch <code>PoV</code> from validators, when requested via <code>FetchPoV</code> message from
backing (<code>pov_requester</code> module).</li>
</ul>
<p>The backing subsystem is responsible of making available data available in the
local <code>Availability Store</code> upon validation. This subsystem will serve any
network requests by querying that store.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-4"><a class="header" href="#protocol-4">Protocol</a></h2>
<p>This subsystem does not handle any peer set messages, but the <code>pov_requester</code>
does connect to validators of the same backing group on the validation peer
set, to ensure fast propagation of statements between those validators and for
ensuring already established connections for requesting <code>PoV</code>s. Other than that
this subsystem drives request/response protocols.</p>

<h3 id="pov-requester"><a class="header" href="#pov-requester">PoV Requester</a></h3>
<p>The PoV requester in the <code>pov_requester</code> module takes care of staying connected
to validators of the current backing group of this very validator on the <code>Validation</code>
peer set and it will handle <code>FetchPoV</code> requests by issuing network requests to
those validators. It will check the hash of the received <code>PoV</code>, but will not do any
further validation. That needs to be done by the original <code>FetchPoV</code> sender
(backing subsystem).</p>
<h3 id="chunk-requester"><a class="header" href="#chunk-requester">Chunk Requester</a></h3>
<p>After a candidate is backed, the availability of the PoV block must be confirmed
by 2/3+ of all validators. The chunk requester is responsible of making that
availability a reality.</p>
<p>It does that by querying checking occupied cores for all active leaves. For each
occupied core it will spawn a task fetching the erasure chunk which has the
<code>ValidatorIndex</code> of the node. For this an <code>ChunkFetchingRequest</code> is issued, via
substrate's generic request/response protocol.</p>
<p>The spawned task will start trying to fetch the chunk from validators in
responsible group of the occupied core, in a random order. For ensuring that we
use already open TCP connections wherever possible, the requester maintains a
cache and preserves that random order for the entire session.</p>
<p>Note however that, because not all validators in a group have to be actual
backers, not all of them are required to have the needed chunk. This in turn
could lead to low throughput, as we have to wait for fetches to fail,
before reaching a validator finally having our chunk. We do rank back validators
not delivering our chunk, but as backers could vary from block to block on a
perfectly legitimate basis, this is still not ideal. See issues <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/2509">2509</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/2512">2512</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>The current implementation also only fetches chunks for occupied cores in blocks
in active leaves. This means though, if active leaves skips a block or we are
particularly slow in fetching our chunk, we might not fetch our chunk if
availability reached 2/3 fast enough (slot becomes free). This is not desirable
as we would like as many validators as possible to have their chunk. See this
<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/2513">issue</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="serving"><a class="header" href="#serving">Serving</a></h3>
<p>On the other side the subsystem will listen for incoming <code>ChunkFetchingRequest</code>s
and <code>PoVFetchingRequest</code>s from the network bridge and will respond to queries,
by looking the requested chunks and <code>PoV</code>s up in the availability store, this
happens in the <code>responder</code> module.</p>
<p>We rely on the backing subsystem to make available data available locally in the
<code>Availability Store</code> after it has validated it.</p>

<p>The approval subsystems implement the node-side of the <a href="node/approval/../../protocol-approval.html">Approval Protocol</a>.</p>
<p>We make a divide between the <a href="node/approval/approval-voting.html">assignment/voting logic</a> and the <a href="node/approval/approval-distribution.html">distribution logic</a> that distributes assignment certifications and approval votes. The logic in the assignment and voting also informs the GRANDPA voting rule on how to vote.</p>
<p>These subsystems are intended to flag issues and begin participating in live disputes. Dispute subsystems also track all observed votes (backing, approval, and dispute-specific) by all validators on all candidates.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="approval-voting"><a class="header" href="#approval-voting">Approval Voting</a></h1>
<p>Reading the <a href="node/approval/../../protocol-approval.html">section on the approval protocol</a> will likely be necessary to understand the aims of this subsystem.</p>
<p>Approval votes are split into two parts: Assignments and Approvals. Validators first broadcast their assignment to indicate intent to check a candidate. Upon successfully checking, they broadcast an approval vote. If a validator doesn't broadcast their approval vote shortly after issuing an assignment, this is an indication that they are being prevented from recovering or validating the block data and that more validators should self-select to check the candidate. This is known as a &quot;no-show&quot;.</p>
<p>The core of this subsystem is a Tick-based timer loop, where Ticks are 500ms. We also reason about time in terms of <code>DelayTranche</code>s, which measure the number of ticks elapsed since a block was produced. We track metadata for all un-finalized but included candidates. We compute our local assignments to check each candidate, as well as which <code>DelayTranche</code> those assignments may be minimally triggered at. As the same candidate may appear in more than one block, we must produce our potential assignments for each (Block, Candidate) pair. The timing loop is based on waiting for assignments to become no-shows or waiting to broadcast and begin our own assignment to check.</p>
<p>Another main component of this subsystem is the logic for determining when a (Block, Candidate) pair has been approved and when to broadcast and trigger our own assignment. Once a (Block, Candidate) pair has been approved, we mark a corresponding bit in the <code>BlockEntry</code> that indicates the candidate has been approved under the block. When we trigger our own assignment, we broadcast it via Approval Distribution, begin fetching the data from Availability Recovery, and then pass it through to the Candidate Validation. Once these steps are successful, we issue our approval vote. If any of these steps fail, we don't issue any vote and will &quot;no-show&quot; from the perspective of other validators in addition a dispute is raised via the dispute-coordinator, by sending <code>IssueLocalStatement</code>.</p>
<p>Where this all fits into Polkadot is via block finality. Our goal is to not finalize any block containing a candidate that is not approved. We provide a hook for a custom GRANDPA voting rule - GRANDPA makes requests of the form (target, minimum) consisting of a target block (i.e. longest chain) that it would like to finalize, and a minimum block which, due to the rules of GRANDPA, must be voted on. The minimum is typically the last finalized block, but may be beyond it, in the case of having a last-round-estimate beyond the last finalized. Thus, our goal is to inform GRANDPA of some block between target and minimum which we believe can be finalized safely. We do this by iterating backwards from the target to the minimum and finding the longest continuous chain from minimum where all candidates included by those blocks have been approved.</p>

<p>The approval voting subsystem is responsible for casting votes and determining approval of candidates and as a result, blocks.</p>

This is done by loading the <code>StoredBlockRange</code>, iterating through each block number, iterating through each block hash, and iterating through each candidate referenced by each block. Although this is <code>O(o*n*p)</code>, we don't expect to have more than a few unfinalized blocks at any time and in extreme cases, a few thousand.

We update our <code>StoredBlockRange</code> to begin at <code>b+1</code>. Additionally, we remove all block entries and candidates referenced by them up to and including <code>b</code>. Lastly, we prune out all descendants of <code>h</code> transitively: when we remove a <code>BlockEntry</code> with number <code>b</code> that is not equal to <code>h</code>, we recursively delete all the <code>BlockEntry</code>s referenced as children. We remove the <code>block_assignments</code> entry for the block hash and if <code>block_assignments</code> is now empty, remove the <code>CandidateEntry</code>.

<p>On receiving an <code>OverseerSignal::ActiveLeavesUpdate(update)</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We determine the set of new blocks that were not in our previous view. This is done by querying the ancestry of all new items in the view and contrasting against the stored <code>BlockNumber</code>s. Typically, there will be only one new block. We fetch the headers and information on these blocks from the <code>ChainApi</code> subsystem. Stale leaves in the update can be ignored.</li>
<li>We update the <code>StoredBlockRange</code> and the <code>BlockNumber</code> maps.</li>
<li>We use the <code>RuntimeApiSubsystem</code> to determine information about these blocks. It is generally safe to assume that runtime state is available for recent, unfinalized blocks. In the case that it isn't, it means that we are catching up to the head of the chain and needn't worry about assignments to those blocks anyway, as the security assumption of the protocol tolerates nodes being temporarily offline or out-of-date.
<ul>
<li>We fetch the set of candidates included by each block by dispatching a <code>RuntimeApiRequest::CandidateEvents</code> and checking the <code>CandidateIncluded</code> events.</li>
<li>We fetch the session of the block by dispatching a <code>session_index_for_child</code> request with the parent-hash of the block.</li>
<li>If the <code>session index - APPROVAL_SESSIONS &gt; state.earliest_session</code>, then bump <code>state.earliest_sessions</code> to that amount and prune earlier sessions.</li>
<li>If the session isn't in our <code>state.session_info</code>, load the session info for it and for all sessions since the earliest-session, including the earliest-session, if that is missing. And it can be, just after pruning, if we've done a big jump forward, as is the case when we've just finished chain synchronization.</li>
<li>If any of the runtime API calls fail, we just warn and skip the block.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We use the <code>RuntimeApiSubsystem</code> to determine the set of candidates included in these blocks and use BABE logic to determine the slot number and VRF of the blocks.</li>
<li>We also note how late we appear to have received the block. We create a <code>BlockEntry</code> for each block and a <code>CandidateEntry</code> for each candidate obtained from <code>CandidateIncluded</code> events after making a <code>RuntimeApiRequest::CandidateEvents</code> request.</li>
<li>For each candidate, if the amount of needed approvals is more than the validators remaining after the backing group of the candidate is subtracted, then the candidate is insta-approved as approval would be impossible otherwise. If all candidates in the block are insta-approved, or there are no candidates in the block, then the block is insta-approved. If the block is insta-approved, a <a href="node/approval/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#chainselectionmessage"><code>ChainSelectionMessage::Approved</code></a> should be sent for the block.</li>
<li>Ensure that the <code>CandidateEntry</code> contains a <code>block_assignments</code> entry for the block, with the correct backing group set.</li>
<li>If a validator in this session, compute and assign <code>our_assignment</code> for the <code>block_assignments</code>
<ul>
<li>Only if not a member of the backing group.</li>
<li>Run <code>RelayVRFModulo</code> and <code>RelayVRFDelay</code> according to the <a href="node/approval/../../protocol-approval.html#assignment-criteria">the approvals protocol section</a>.

<p>On receiving a <code>ApprovalVotingMessage::CheckAndImportAssignment</code> message, we check the assignment cert against the block entry. The cert itself contains information necessary to determine the candidate that is being assigned-to. In detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load the <code>BlockEntry</code> for the relay-parent referenced by the message. If there is none, return <code>AssignmentCheckResult::Bad</code>.</li>
<li>Fetch the <code>SessionInfo</code> for the session of the block</li>
<li>Determine the assignment key of the validator based on that.</li>
<li>Determine the claimed core index by looking up the candidate with given index in <code>block_entry.candidates</code>. Return <code>AssignmentCheckResult::Bad</code> if missing.</li>
<li>Check the assignment cert
<ul>
<li>If the cert kind is <code>RelayVRFModulo</code>, then the certificate is valid as long as <code>sample &lt; session_info.relay_vrf_samples</code> and the VRF is valid for the validator's key with the input <code>block_entry.relay_vrf_story ++ sample.encode()</code> as described with <a href="node/approval/../../protocol-approval.html#assignment-criteria">the approvals protocol section</a>. We set <code>core_index = vrf.make_bytes().to_u32() % session_info.n_cores</code>. If the <code>BlockEntry</code> causes inclusion of a candidate at <code>core_index</code>, then this is a valid assignment for the candidate at <code>core_index</code> and has delay tranche 0. Otherwise, it can be ignored.</li>
<li>If the cert kind is <code>RelayVRFDelay</code>, then we check if the VRF is valid for the validator's key with the input <code>block_entry.relay_vrf_story ++ cert.core_index.encode()</code> as described in <a href="node/approval/../../protocol-approval.html#assignment-criteria">the approvals protocol section</a>. The cert can be ignored if the block did not cause inclusion of a candidate on that core index. Otherwise, this is a valid assignment for the included candidate. The delay tranche for the assignment is determined by reducing <code>(vrf.make_bytes().to_u64() % (session_info.n_delay_tranches + session_info.zeroth_delay_tranche_width)).saturating_sub(session_info.zeroth_delay_tranche_width)</code>.</li>
<li>We also check that the core index derived by the output is covered by the <code>VRFProof</code> by means of an auxiliary signature.</li>
<li>If the delay tranche is too far in the future, return <code>AssignmentCheckResult::TooFarInFuture</code>.</li>

<p>This logic is for inspecting an approval entry that tracks the assignments received, along with information on which assignments have corresponding approval votes. Inspection also involves the current time and expected requirements and is used to help the higher-level code determine the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether to broadcast the local assignment</li>
<li>Whether to check that the candidate entry has been completely approved.</li>
<li>If the candidate is waiting on approval, when to schedule the next wakeup of the <code>(candidate, block)</code> pair at a point where the state machine could be advanced.</li>
</ul>
<p>These routines are pure functions which only depend on the environmental state. The expectation is that this determination is re-run every time we attempt to update an approval entry: either when we trigger a wakeup to advance the state machine based on a no-show or our own broadcast, or when we receive further assignments or approvals from the network.</p>
<p>Thus it may be that at some point in time, we consider that tranches 0..X is required to be considered, but as we receive more information, we might require fewer tranches. Or votes that we perceived to be missing and require replacement are filled in and change our view.</p>

<p><strong>Clock-drift and Tranche-taking</strong></p>
<p>Our vote-counting procedure depends heavily on how we interpret time based on the presence of no-shows - assignments which have no corresponding approval after some time.</p>
<p>We have this is because of how we handle no-shows: we keep track of the depth of no-shows we are covering.</p>
<p>As an example: there may be initial no-shows in tranche 0. It'll take <code>no_show_duration</code> ticks before those are considered no-shows. Then, we don't want to immediately take <code>no_show_duration</code> more tranches. Instead, we want to take one tranche for each uncovered no-show. However, as we take those tranches, there may be further no-shows. Since these depth-1 no-shows should have only been triggered after the depth-0 no-shows were already known to be no-shows, we need to discount the local clock by <code>no_show_duration</code> to  see whether these should be considered no-shows or not. There may be malicious parties who broadcast their assignment earlier than they were meant to, who shouldn't be counted as instant no-shows. We continue onwards to cover all depth-1 no-shows which may lead to depth-2 no-shows and so on.</p>
<p>Likewise, when considering how many tranches to take, the no-show depth should be used to apply a depth-discount or clock drift to the <code>tranche_now</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start with <code>depth = 0</code>.</li>
<li>Set a clock drift of <code>depth * no_show_duration</code></li>
<li>Take tranches up to <code>tranche_now - clock_drift</code> until all needed assignments are met.</li>
<li>Keep track of the <code>next_no_show</code> according to the clock drift, as we go.</li>
<li>Keep track of the <code>last_assignment_tick</code> as we go.</li>
<li>If running out of tranches before then, return <code>Pending { considered, next_no_show, maximum_broadcast, clock_drift }</code></li>
<li>If there are no no-shows, return <code>Exact { needed, tolerated_missing, next_no_show, last_assignment_tick }</code></li>
<li><code>maximum_broadcast</code> is either <code>DelayTranche::max_value()</code> at tranche 0 or otherwise by the last considered tranche + the number of uncovered no-shows at this point.</li>
<li>If there are no-shows, return to the beginning, incrementing <code>depth</code> and attempting to cover the number of no-shows. Each no-show must be covered by a non-empty tranche, which are tranches that have at least one assignment. Each non-empty tranche covers exactly one no-show.</li>
<li>If at any point, it seems that all validators are required, do an early return with <code>RequiredTranches::All</code> which indicates that everyone should broadcast.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="check-approval"><a class="header" href="#check-approval">Check Approval</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Check whether a candidate is approved under a particular block.</li>
<li>Requires <code>(block_entry, candidate_entry, approval_entry, n_tranches)</code></li>
<li>If we have <code>3 * n_approvals &gt; n_validators</code>, return true. This is because any set with f+1 validators must have at least one honest validator, who has approved the candidate.</li>
<li>If <code>n_tranches</code> is <code>RequiredTranches::Pending</code>, return false</li>
<li>If <code>n_tranches</code> is <code>RequiredTranches::All</code>, return false.</li>
<li>If <code>n_tranches</code> is <code>RequiredTranches::Exact { tranche, tolerated_missing, latest_assignment_tick, .. }</code>, then we return whether all assigned validators up to <code>tranche</code> less <code>tolerated_missing</code> have approved and <code>latest_assignment_tick + APPROVAL_DELAY &gt;= tick_now</code>.
<ul>
<li>e.g. if we had 5 tranches and 1 tolerated missing, we would accept only if all but 1 of assigned validators in tranches 0..=5 have approved. In that example, we also accept all validators in tranches 0..=5 having approved, but that would indicate that the <code>RequiredTranches</code> value was incorrectly constructed, so it is not realistic. <code>tolerated_missing</code> actually represents covered no-shows. If there are more missing approvals than there are tolerated missing, that indicates that there are some assignments which are not yet no-shows, but may become no-shows, and we should wait for the validators to either approve or become no-shows.</li>
<li>e.g. If the above passes and the <code>latest_assignment_tick</code> was 5 and the current tick was 6, then we'd return false.</li>

<p>A subsystem for the distribution of assignments and approvals for approval checks on candidates over the network.</p>
<p>The <a href="node/approval/approval-voting.html">Approval Voting</a> subsystem is responsible for active participation in a protocol designed to select a sufficient number of validators to check each and every candidate which appears in the relay chain. Statements of participation in this checking process are divided into two kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assignments</strong> indicate that validators have been selected to do checking</li>
<li><strong>Approvals</strong> indicate that validators have checked and found the candidate satisfactory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="node/approval/approval-voting.html">Approval Voting</a> subsystem handles all the issuing and tallying of this protocol, but this subsystem is responsible for the disbursal of statements among the validator-set.</p>
<p>The inclusion pipeline of candidates concludes after availability, and only after inclusion do candidates actually get pushed into the approval checking pipeline. As such, this protocol deals with the candidates <em>made available by</em> particular blocks, as opposed to the candidates which actually appear within those blocks, which are the candidates <em>backed by</em> those blocks. Unless stated otherwise, whenever we reference a candidate partially by block hash, we are referring to the set of candidates <em>made available by</em> those blocks.</p>
<p>We implement this protocol as a gossip protocol, and like other parachain-related gossip protocols our primary concerns are about ensuring fast message propagation while maintaining an upper bound on the number of messages any given node must store at any time.</p>
<p>Approval messages should always follow assignments, so we need to be able to discern two pieces of information based on our <a href="node/approval/../../types/network.html#universal-types">View</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is a particular assignment relevant under a given <code>View</code>?</li>
<li>Is a particular approval relevant to any assignment in a set?</li>
</ol>
<p>For our own local view, these two queries  must not yield false negatives. When applied to our peers' views, it is acceptable for them to yield false negatives. The reason for that is that our peers' views may be beyond ours, and we are not capable of fully evaluating them. Once we have caught up, we can check again for false negatives to continue distributing.</p>
<p>For assignments, what we need to be checking is whether we are aware of the (block, candidate) pair that the assignment references. For approvals, we need to be aware of an assignment by the same validator which references the candidate being approved.</p>
<p>However, awareness on its own of a (block, candidate) pair would imply that even ancient candidates all the way back to the genesis are relevant. We are actually not interested in anything before finality.</p>
<p>We gossip assignments along a grid topology produced by the <a href="node/approval/../utility/gossip-support.html">Gossip Support Subsystem</a> and also to a few random peers. The first time we accept an assignment or approval, regardless of the source, which originates from a validator peer in a shared dimension of the grid, we propagate the message to validator peers in the unshared dimension as well as a few random peers.</p>
<p>But, in case these mechanisms don't work on their own, we need to trade bandwidth for protocol liveness by introducing aggression.</p>
<p>Aggression has 3 levels:
Aggression Level 0: The basic behaviors described above.
Aggression Level 1: The originator of a message sends to all peers. Other peers follow the rules above.
Aggression Level 2: All peers send all messages to all their row and column neighbors. This means that each validator will, on average, receive each message approximately 2*sqrt(n) times.</p>
<p>These aggression levels are chosen based on how long a block has taken to finalize: assignments and approvals related to the unfinalized block will be propagated with more aggression. In particular, it's only the earliest unfinalized blocks that aggression should be applied to, because descendants may be unfinalized only by virtue of being descendants.</p>

<p>This section is for the node-side subsystems that lead to participation in disputes. There are five major roles that validator nodes must participate in when it comes to disputes
* Detection. Detect bad parablocks, either during candidate backing or approval checking, and initiate a dispute.
* Participation. Participate in active disputes. When a node becomes aware of a dispute, it should recover the data for the disputed block, check the validity of the parablock, and issue a statement regarding the validity of the parablock.
* Distribution. Validators should notify each other of active disputes and relevant statements over the network.
* Submission. When authoring a block, a validator should inspect the state of the parent block and provide any information about disputes that the chain needs as part of the <code>ParaInherent</code>. This should initialize new disputes on-chain as necessary.
* Fork-choice and Finality. When observing a block issuing a <code>DisputeRollback</code> digest in the header, that branch of the relay chain should be abandoned all the way back to the indicated block. When voting on chains in GRANDPA, no chains that contain blocks with active disputes or disputes that concluded invalid should be voted on.</p>
<h2 id="components-1"><a class="header" href="#components-1">Components</a></h2>
<h3 id="dispute-coordinator"><a class="header" href="#dispute-coordinator">Dispute Coordinator</a></h3>
<p>This component is responsible for coordinating other subsystems around disputes.</p>
<p>This component should track all statements received from all validators over some window of sessions. This includes backing statements, approval votes, and statements made specifically for disputes. This will be used to identify disagreements or instances where validators conflict with themselves.</p>
<p>This is responsible for tracking and initiating disputes. Disputes will be initiated either externally by another subsystem which has identified an issue with a parablock or internally upon observing two statements which conflict with each other on the validity of a parablock.</p>
<p>No more than one statement by each validator on each side of the dispute needs to be stored. That is, validators are allowed to participate on both sides of the dispute, although we won't write code to do so. Such behavior has negative extractable value in the runtime.</p>
<p>This will notify the dispute participation subsystem of a new dispute if the local validator has not issued any statements on the disputed candidate already.</p>
<p>Locally authored statements related to disputes will be forwarded to the dispute distribution subsystem.</p>
<p>This subsystem also provides two further behaviors for the interactions between disputes and fork-choice</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhancing the finality voting rule. Given description of a chain and candidates included at different heights in that chain, it returns the <code>BlockHash</code> corresponding to the highest <code>BlockNumber</code> that there are no disputes before. I expect that we will slightly change <code>ApprovalVoting::ApprovedAncestor</code> to return this set and then the target block to vote on will be further constrained by this function.</li>
<li>Chain roll-backs. Whenever importing new blocks, the header should be scanned for a roll-back digest. If there is one, the chain should be rolled back according to the digest. I expect this would be implemented with a <code>ChainApi</code> function and possibly an <code>ApprovalVoting</code> function to clean up the approval voting DB.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dispute-participation-1"><a class="header" href="#dispute-participation-1">Dispute Participation</a></h3>
<p>This subsystem ties together the dispute tracker, availability recovery, candidate validation, and dispute distribution subsystems. When notified of a new dispute by the Dispute Tracker, the data should be recovered, the validation code loaded from the relay chain, and the candidate is executed.</p>
<p>A statement depending on the outcome of the execution is produced, signed, and imported to the dispute tracker.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-distribution"><a class="header" href="#dispute-distribution">Dispute Distribution</a></h3>
<p>This is a networking component by which validators notify each other of live disputes and statements on those disputes.</p>
<p>Validators will in the future distribute votes to each other via the network, but at the moment learn of disputes just from watching the chain.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dispute-coordinator-1"><a class="header" href="#dispute-coordinator-1">Dispute Coordinator</a></h1>
<p>The coordinator is the central subsystem of the node-side components which
participate in disputes. It wraps a database, which is used to track statements
observed by <em>all</em> validators over some window of sessions. Votes older than this
session window are pruned.</p>
<p>In particular the dispute-coordinator is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring that the node is able to raise a dispute in case an invalid candidate
is found during approval checking.</li>
<li>Ensuring lazy approval votes (votes given without running the parachain
validation function) will be recorded, so lazy nodes can get slashed properly.</li>
<li>Coordinating actual participation in a dispute, ensuring that the node
participates in any justified dispute in a way that ensures resolution of
disputes on the network even in the case of many disputes raised (flood/DoS
scenario).</li>
<li>Provide an API for chain selection, so we can prevent finalization of any
chain which has included candidates for which a dispute is either ongoing or
concluded invalid and avoid building on chains with an included invalid
candidate.</li>
<li>Provide an API for retrieving (resolved) disputes, including all votes, both
implicit (approval, backing) and explicit dispute votes. So validators can get
rewarded/slashed accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ensuring-that-disputes-can-be-raised"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-that-disputes-can-be-raised">Ensuring That Disputes Can Be Raised</a></h2>
<p>If a candidate turns out invalid in approval checking, the <code>approval-voting</code>
subsystem will try to issue a dispute. For this, it will send a message
<code>DisputeCoordinatorMessage::IssueLocalStatement</code> to the dispute coordinator,
indicating to cast an explicit invalid vote. It is the responsibility of the
dispute coordinator on reception of such a message to create and sign that
explicit invalid vote and trigger a dispute if none for that candidate is
already ongoing.</p>
<p>In order to raise a dispute, a node has to be able to provide two opposing votes.
Given that the reason of the backing phase is to have validators with skin in
the game, the opposing valid vote will very likely be a backing vote. It could
also be some already cast approval vote, but the significant point here is: As
long as we have backing votes available, any node will be able to raise a
dispute.</p>
<p>Therefore a vital responsibility of the dispute coordinator is to make sure
backing votes are available for all candidates that might still get disputed. To
accomplish this task in an efficient way the dispute-coordinator relies on chain
scraping. Whenever a candidate gets backed on chain, we record in chain storage
the backing votes imported in that block. This way, given the chain state for a
given relay chain block, we can retrieve via a provided runtime API the backing
votes imported by that block. The dispute coordinator makes sure to query those
votes for any non finalized blocks: In case of missed blocks, it will do chain
traversal as necessary.</p>
<p>Relying on chain scraping is very efficient for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Votes are already batched. We import all available backing votes for a
candidate all at once. If instead we imported votes from candidate-backing as
they came along, we would import each vote individually which is
inefficient in the current dispute coordinator implementation (quadratic
complexity).</li>
<li>We also import less votes in total, as we avoid importing statements for
candidates that never got successfully backed on any chain.</li>
</ol>
<p>It also is secure, because disputes are only ever raised in the approval voting
phase. A node only starts the approval process after it has seen a candidate
included on some chain, for that to happen it must have been backed previously.
Therefore backing votes are available at that point in time. Signals are
processed first, so even if a block is skipped and we only start importing
backing votes on the including block, we will have seen the backing votes by the
time we process messages from approval voting.</p>
<p>In summary, for making it possible for a dispute to be raised, recording of
backing votes from chain is sufficient and efficient. In particular there is no
need to preemptively import approval votes, which has shown to be a very
inefficient process. (Quadratic complexity adds up, with 35 votes in total per candidate)</p>
<p>Approval votes are very relevant nonetheless as we are going to see in the next
section.</p>
<h2 id="ensuring-lazy-approval-votes-will-be-recorded"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-lazy-approval-votes-will-be-recorded">Ensuring Lazy Approval Votes Will Be Recorded</a></h2>
<h3 id="ensuring-recording"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-recording">Ensuring Recording</a></h3>
<p>While there is no need to record approval votes in the dispute coordinator
preemptively, we do need to make sure they are recorded when a dispute
actually happens. This is because only votes recorded by the dispute
coordinator will be considered for slashing. It is sufficient for our
threat model that malicious backers are slashed as opposed to both backers and
approval checkers. However, we still must import approval votes from the approvals
process into the disputes process to ensure that lazy approval checkers
actually run the parachain validation function. Slashing lazy approval checkers is necessary, else we risk a useless approvals process where every approval
checker blindly votes valid for every candidate. If we did not import approval
votes, lazy nodes would likely cast a properly checked explicit vote as part
of the dispute in addition to their blind approval vote and thus avoid a slash.
With the 2/3rd honest assumption it seems unrealistic that lazy approval voters
will keep sending unchecked approval votes once they became aware of a raised
dispute. Hence the most crucial approval votes to import are the early ones
(tranche 0), to take into account network latencies and such we still want to
import approval votes at a later point in time as well (in particular we need
to make sure the dispute can conclude, but more on that later).</p>
<p>As mentioned already previously, importing votes is most efficient when batched.
At the same time approval voting and disputes are running concurrently so
approval votes are expected to trickle in still, when a dispute is already
ongoing.</p>
<p>Hence, we have the following requirements for importing approval votes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only import them when there is a dispute, because otherwise we are
wasting lots of resources <em>always</em> for the exceptional case of a dispute.</li>
<li>Import votes batched when possible, to avoid quadratic import complexity.</li>
<li>Take into account that approval voting is still ongoing, while a dispute is
already running.</li>
</ol>
<p>With a design where approval voting sends votes to the dispute-coordinator by
itself, we would need to make approval voting aware of ongoing disputes and
once it is aware it could start sending all already existing votes batched and
trickling in votes as they come. The problem with this is, that it adds some
unnecessary complexity to approval-voting and also we might still import most of
the votes unbatched, but one-by-one, depending on what point in time the dispute
was raised.</p>
<p>Instead of the dispute coordinator informing approval-voting of an ongoing
dispute for it to begin forwarding votes to the dispute coordinator, it makes
more sense for the dispute-coordinator to just ask approval-voting for votes of
candidates in dispute. This way, the dispute coordinator can also pick the best
time for maximizing the number of votes in the batch.</p>
<p>Now the question remains, when should the dispute coordinator ask
approval-voting for votes? As argued above already, querying approval votes at
the beginning of the dispute, will likely already take care of most malicious
votes. Still we would like to have a record of all, if possible. So what are
other points in time we might query approval votes?</p>
<p>In fact for slashing it is only relevant to have them once the dispute
concluded, so we can query approval voting the moment the dispute concludes!
There are two potential caveats with this though:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Timing: We would like to rely as little as possible on implementation details
of approval voting. In particular, if the dispute is ongoing for a long time,
do we have any guarantees that approval votes are kept around long enough by
approval voting? Will approval votes still be present by the time the
dispute concludes in all cases? The answer is nuanced, but in general we
cannot rely on it. The problem is first, that finalization and
approval-voting is an off-chain process so there is no global consensus: As
soon as at least f+1 honest (f=n/3, where n is the number of
validators/nodes) nodes have seen the dispute conclude, finalization will
take place and approval votes will be cleared. This would still be fine, if
we had some guarantees that those honest nodes will be able to include those
votes in a block. This guarantee does not exist unfortunately, we will
discuss the problem and solutions in more detail [below][#Ensuring Chain Import].</p>
<p>The second problem is that approval-voting will abandon votes as soon as a
chain can no longer be finalized (some other/better fork already has been).
This second problem can somehow be mitigated by also importing votes as soon
as a dispute is detected, but not fully resolved. It is still inherently
racy. The problem can be solved in at least two ways: Either go back to full
eager import of approval votes into the dispute-coordinator in some more
efficient manner or by changing requirements on approval-voting, making it
hold on votes longer than necessary for approval-voting itself. Conceptually
both solutions are equivalent, as we make sure votes are available even
without an ongoing dispute. For now, in the interest of time we punt on this
issue: If nodes import votes as soon as a dispute is raised in addition to
when it concludes, we have a good chance of getting relevant votes and even
if not, the fundamental security properties will still hold: Backers are
getting slashed, therefore gambler's ruin is maintained. We would still like
to fix this at <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5864">some
point</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There could be a chicken and egg problem: If we wait for approval vote import
for the dispute to conclude, we would run into a problem if we needed those
approval votes to get enough votes to conclude the dispute. Luckily it turns
out that this is not quite true or at least can be made not true easily: As
already mentioned, approval voting and disputes are running concurrently, but
not only that, they race with each other! A node might simultaneously start
participating in a dispute via the dispute coordinator, due to learning about
a dispute via dispute-distribution, while also participating in approval
voting. By distributing our own approval vote we make sure the dispute can
conclude regardless how the race ended (we either participate explicitly
anyway or we sent our already present approval vote). By importing all
approval votes we make it possible to slash lazy approval voters, even
if they also cast an invalid explicit vote.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusion: As long as we make sure, if our own approval vote gets imported
(which would prevent dispute participation) to also distribute it via
dispute-distribution, disputes can conclude. To mitigate raciness with
approval-voting deleting votes we will import approval votes twice during a
dispute: Once when it is raised, to make as sure as possible to see approval
votes also for abandoned forks and second when the dispute concludes, to
maximize the amount of potentially malicious approval votes to be recorded. The
raciness obviously is not fully resolved by this, <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5864">a
ticket</a> exists.</p>
<p>Ensuring vote import on chain is covered in the next section.</p>
<p>As already touched: Honest nodes
will likely validate twice, once in approval voting and once via
dispute-participation. Avoiding that does not really seem worthwhile though, as
disputes are for one exceptional, so a little wasted effort won't affect
everyday performance - second, even with eager importing of approval votes,
those doubled work is still present as disputes and approvals are racing. Every
time participation is faster than approval, a node would do double work.</p>
<h3 id="ensuring-chain-import"><a class="header" href="#ensuring-chain-import">Ensuring Chain Import</a></h3>
<p>While in the previous section we discussed means for nodes to ensure relevant
votes are recorded so lazy approval checkers get slashed properly, it is crucial
to also discuss the actual chain import. Only if we guarantee that recorded votes
will also get imported on chain (on all potential chains really) we will succeed
in executing slashes. Particularly we need to make sure backing votes end up on
chain consistantly. In contrast recording and slashing lazy approval voters only
needs to be likely, not certain.</p>
<p>Dispute distribution will make sure all explicit dispute votes get distributed
among nodes which includes current block producers (current authority set) which
is an important property: If the dispute carries on across an era change, we
need to ensure that the new validator set will learn about any disputes and
their votes, so they can put that information on chain. Dispute-distribution
luckily has this property and always sends votes to the current authority set.
The issue is, for dispute-distribution, nodes send only their own explicit (or
in some cases their approval vote) in addition to some opposing vote. This
guarantees that at least some backing or approval vote will be present at the
block producer, but we don't have a 100% guarantee to have votes for all
backers, even less for approval checkers.</p>
<p>Reason for backing votes: While backing votes will be present on at least some
chain, that does not mean that any such chain is still considered for block
production in the current set - they might only exist on an already abandoned
fork. This means a block producer that just joined the set, might not have seen
any of them.</p>
<p>For approvals it is even more tricky and less necessary: Approval voting together
with finalization is a completely off-chain process therefore those protocols
don't care about block production at all. Approval votes only have a guarantee of
being propagated between the nodes that are responsible for finalizing the
concerned blocks. This implies that on an era change the current authority set,
will not necessarily get informed about any approval votes for the previous era.
Hence even if all validators of the previous era successfully recorded all approval
votes in the dispute coordinator, they won't get a chance to put them on chain,
hence they won't be considered for slashing.</p>
<p>It is important to note, that the essential properties of the system still hold:
Dispute-distribution will distribute at <em>least one</em> &quot;valid&quot; vote to the current
authority set, hence at least one node will get slashed in case of outcome
&quot;invalid&quot;. Also in reality the validator set is rarely exchanged 100%, therefore
in practice some validators in the current authority set will overlap with the
ones in the previous set and will be able to record votes on chain.</p>
<p>Still, for maximum accountability we need to make sure a previous authority set
can communicate votes to the next one, regardless of any chain: This is yet to
be implemented see section &quot;Resiliency&quot; in dispute-distribution and
<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/3398">this</a> ticket.</p>
<h2 id="coordinating-actual-dispute-participation"><a class="header" href="#coordinating-actual-dispute-participation">Coordinating Actual Dispute Participation</a></h2>
<p>Once the dispute coordinator learns about a dispute, it is its responsibility to
make sure the local node participates in that dispute.</p>
<p>The dispute coordinator learns about a dispute by importing votes from either
chain scraping or from dispute-distribution. If it finds opposing votes (always
the case when coming from dispute-distribution), it records the presence of a
dispute. Then, in case it does not find any local vote for that dispute already,
it needs to trigger participation in the dispute (see previous section for
considerations when the found local vote is an approval vote).</p>
<p>Participation means, recovering availability and re-evaluating the POV. The
result of that validation (either valid or invalid) will be the node's vote on
that dispute: Either explicit &quot;invalid&quot; or &quot;valid&quot;. The dispute coordinator will
inform <code>dispute-distribution</code> about our vote and <code>dispute-distribution</code> will make
sure that our vote gets distributed to all other validators.</p>
<p>Nothing ever is that easy though. We can not blindly import anything that comes
along and trigger participation no matter what.</p>
<h3 id="spam-considerations"><a class="header" href="#spam-considerations">Spam Considerations</a></h3>
<p>In Polkadot's security model, it is important that attempts to attack the system
result in a slash of the offenders. Therefore we need to make sure that this
slash is actually happening. Attackers could try to prevent the slashing from
taking place, by overwhelming validators with disputes in such a way that no
single dispute ever concludes, because nodes are busy processing newly incoming
ones. Other attacks are imaginable as well, like raising disputes for candidates
that don't exist, just filling up everyone's disk slowly or worse making nodes
try to participate, which will result in lots of network requests for recovering
availability.</p>
<p>The last point brings up a significant consideration in general: Disputes are
about escalation: Every node will suddenly want to check, instead of only a few.
A single message will trigger the whole network to start significant amount of
work and will cause lots of network traffic and messages. Hence the
dispute system is very susceptible to being a brutal amplifier for DoS attacks,
resulting in DoS attacks to become very easy and cheap, if we are not careful.</p>
<p>One counter measure we are taking is making raising of disputes a costly thing:
If you raise a dispute, because you claim a candidate is invalid, although it is
in fact valid - you will get slashed, hence you pay for consuming those
resources. The issue is: This only works if the dispute concerns a candidate
that actually exists!</p>
<p>If a node raises a dispute for a candidate that never got included (became
available) on any chain, then the dispute can never conclude, hence nobody gets
slashed. It makes sense to point out that this is less bad than it might sound
at first, as trying to participate in a dispute for a non existing candidate is
&quot;relatively&quot; cheap. Each node will send out a few hundred tiny request messages
for availability chunks, which all will end up in a tiny response &quot;NoSuchChunk&quot;
and then no participation will actually happen as there is nothing to
participate. Malicious nodes could provide chunks, which would make things more
costly, but at the full expense of the attackers bandwidth - no amplification
here. I am bringing that up for completeness only: Triggering a thousand nodes
to send out a thousand tiny network messages by just sending out a single
garbage message, is still a significant amplification and is nothing to ignore -
this could absolutely be used to cause harm!</p>
<h4 id="participation"><a class="header" href="#participation">Participation</a></h4>
<p>As explained, just blindly participating in any &quot;dispute&quot; that comes along is
not a good idea. First we would like to make sure the dispute is actually
genuine, to prevent cheap DoS attacks. Secondly, in case of genuine disputes, we
would like to conclude one after the other, in contrast to
processing all at the same time, slowing down progress on all of them, bringing
individual processing to a complete halt in the worst case (nodes get overwhelmed
at some stage in the pipeline).</p>
<p>To ensure to only spend significant work on genuine disputes, we only trigger
participation at all on any <em>vote import</em> if any of the following holds true:</p>
<ul>
<li>We saw the disputed candidate included in some not yet finalized block on at
least one fork of the chain.</li>
<li>We have seen the disputed candidate backed in some not yet finalized block on
at least one fork of the chain. This ensures the candidate is at least not
completely made up and there has been some effort already flown into that
candidate. Generally speaking a dispute shouldn't be raised for a candidate
which is backed but is not yet included. Disputes are raised during approval
checking. We participate on such disputes as a precaution - maybe we haven't
seen the <code>CandidateIncluded</code> event yet?</li>
<li>The dispute is already confirmed: Meaning that 1/3+1 nodes already
participated, as this suggests in our threat model that there was at least one
honest node that already voted, so the dispute must be genuine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: A node might be out of sync with the chain and we might only learn about a
block including a candidate, after we learned about the dispute. This means, we
have to re-evaluate participation decisions on block import!</p>
<p>With this, nodes won't waste significant resources on completely made up
candidates. The next step is to process dispute participation in a (globally)
ordered fashion. Meaning a majority of validators should arrive at at least
roughly at the same ordering of participation, for disputes to get resolved one
after another. This order is only relevant if there are lots of disputes, so we
obviously only need to worry about order if participations start queuing up.</p>
<p>We treat participation for candidates that we have seen included with priority
and put them on a priority queue which sorts participation based on the block
number of the relay parent of that candidate and for candidates with the same
relay parent height further by the <code>CandidateHash</code>. This ordering is globally
unique and also prioritizes older candidates.</p>
<p>The latter property makes sense, because if an older candidate turns out invalid,
we can roll back the full chain at once. If we resolved earlier disputes first
and they turned out invalid as well, we might need to roll back a couple of
times instead of just once to the oldest offender. This is obviously a good
idea, in particular it makes it impossible for an attacker to prevent rolling
back a very old candidate, by keeping raising disputes for newer candidates.</p>
<p>For candidates we have not seen included, but we know are backed (thanks to chain
scraping) or we have seen a dispute with 1/3+1 participation (confirmed dispute)
on them - we put participation on a best-effort queue. It has got the same
ordering as the priority one - by block heights of the relay parent, older blocks
are with priority. There is a possibility not to be able to obtain the block number
of the parent when we are inserting the dispute in the queue. The reason for this
is either the dispute is completely made up or we are out of sync with the other
nodes in terms of last finalized block. The former is very unlikely. If we are
adding a dispute in best-effort it should already be either confirmed or the
candidate is backed. In the latter case we will promote the dispute to the
priority queue once we learn about the new block. NOTE: this is still work in
progress and is tracked by [this issue]
(https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5875).</p>
<h4 id="import"><a class="header" href="#import">Import</a></h4>
<p>In the last section we looked at how to treat queuing participations to handle
heavy dispute load well. This already ensures, that honest nodes won't amplify
cheap DoS attacks. There is one minor issue remaining: Even if we delay
participation until we have some confirmation of the authenticity of the
dispute, we should also not blindly import all votes arriving into the
database as this might be used to just slowly fill up disk space, until the node
is no longer functional. This leads to our last protection mechanism at the
dispute coordinator level (dispute-distribution also has its own), which is spam
slots. For each import, where we don't know whether it might be spam or not we
increment a counter for each signing participant of explicit <code>invalid</code> votes.</p>
<p>What votes do we treat as a potential spam? A vote will increase a spam slot if
and only if all of the following condidions are satisfied:</p>
<ul>
<li>the candidate under dispute is not included on any chain</li>
<li>the dispute is not confirmed</li>
<li>we haven't casted a vote for the dispute</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason this works is because we only need to worry about actual dispute
votes. Import of backing votes are already rate limited and concern only real
candidates for approval votes a similar argument holds (if they come from
approval-voting), but we also don't import them until a dispute already
concluded. For actual dispute votes, we need two opposing votes, so there must be
an explicit <code>invalid</code> vote in the import. Only a third of the validators can be
malicious, so spam disk usage is limited to <code>2*vote_size*n/3*NUM_SPAM_SLOTS</code>, with
<code>n</code> being the number of validators.</p>
<h2 id="attacks--considerations"><a class="header" href="#attacks--considerations">Attacks &amp; Considerations</a></h2>
<p>The following attacks on the priority queue and best-effort queues are
considered in above design.</p>
<h3 id="priority-queue"><a class="header" href="#priority-queue">Priority Queue</a></h3>
<p>On the priority queue, we will only queue participations for candidates we have
seen included on any chain. Any attack attempt would start with a candidate
included on some chain, but an attacker could try to only reveal the including
relay chain blocks to just some honest validators and stop as soon as it learns
that some honest validator would have a relevant approval assignment.</p>
<p>Without revealing the including block to any honest validator, we don't really
have an attack yet. Once the block is revealed though, the above is actually
very hard. Each honest validator will re-distribute the block it just learned
about. This means an attacker would need to pull of a targeted DoS attack, which
allows the validator to send its assignment, but prevents it from forwarding and
sharing the relay chain block.</p>
<p>This sounds already hard enough, provided that we also start participation if
we learned about an including block after the dispute has been raised already
(we need to update participation queues on new leaves), but to be even safer
we choose to have an additional best-effort queue.</p>
<h3 id="best-effort-queue"><a class="header" href="#best-effort-queue">Best-Effort Queue</a></h3>
<p>While attacking the priority queue is already pretty hard, attacking the
best-effort queue is even harder. For a candidate to be a threat, it has to be
included on some chain. For it to be included, it has to have been backed before
and at least n/3 honest nodes must have seen that block, so availability
(inclusion) can be reached. Making a full third of the nodes not further
propagate a block, while at the same time allowing them to fetch chunks, sign
and distribute bitfields seems almost infeasible and even if accomplished, those
nodes would be enough to confirm a dispute and we have not even touched the
above fact that in addition, for an attack, the following including block must
be shared with honest validators as well.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that a successful attack on the priority queue as
outlined above is already outside of our threat model, as it assumes n/3
malicious nodes + additionally malfunctioning/DoSed nodes. Even more so for
attacks on the best-effort queue, as our threat model only allows for n/3
malicious <em>or</em> malfunctioning nodes in total. It would therefore be a valid
decision to ditch the best-effort queue, if it proves to become a burden or
creates other issues.</p>
<p>One issue we should not be worried about though is spam. For abusing best-effort
for spam, the following scenario would be necessary:</p>
<p>An attacker controls a backing group: The attacker can then have candidates
backed and choose to not provide chunks. This should come at a cost to miss out
on rewards for backing, so is not free. At the same time it is rate limited, as
a backing group can only back so many candidates legitimately. (~ 1 per slot):</p>
<ol>
<li>They have to wait until a malicious actor becomes block producer (for causing
additional forks via equivocation for example).</li>
<li>Forks are possible, but if caused by equivocation also not free.</li>
<li>For each fork the attacker has to wait until the candidate times out, for
backing another one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming there can only be a handful of forks, 2) together with 3) the candidate
timeout restriction, frequency should indeed be in the ballpark of once per
slot. Scaling linearly in the number of controlled backing groups, so two groups
would mean 2 backings per slot, ...</p>
<p>So by this reasoning an attacker could only do very limited harm and at the same
time will have to pay some price for it (it will miss out on rewards). Overall
the work done by the network might even be in the same ballpark as if actors
just behaved honestly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Validators would have fetched chunks</li>
<li>Approval checkers would have done approval checks</li>
</ol>
<p>While because of the attack (backing, not providing chunks and afterwards
disputing the candidate), the work for 1000 validators would be:</p>
<p>All validators sending out ~ 1000 tiny requests over already established
connections, with also tiny (byte) responses.</p>
<p>This means around a million requests, while in the honest case it would be ~
10000 (30 approval checkers x330) - where each request triggers a response in
the range of kilobytes. Hence network load alone will likely be higher in the
honest case than in the DoS attempt case, which would mean the DoS attempt
actually reduces load, while also costing rewards.</p>
<p>In the worst case this can happen multiple times, as we would retry that on
every vote import. The effect would still be in the same ballpark as honest
behavior though and can also be mitigated by chilling repeated availability
recovery requests for example.</p>
<h2 id="out-of-scope"><a class="header" href="#out-of-scope">Out of Scope</a></h2>
<h3 id="no-disputes-for-non-included-candidates"><a class="header" href="#no-disputes-for-non-included-candidates">No Disputes for Non Included Candidates</a></h3>
<p>We only ever care about disputes for candidates that have been included on at
least some chain (became available). This is because the availability system was
designed for precisely that: Only with inclusion (availability) we have
guarantees about the candidate to actually be available. Because only then we
have guarantees that malicious backers can be reliably checked and slashed. The
system was also designed for non included candidates to not pose any threat to
the system.</p>
<p>One could think of an (additional) dispute system to make it possible to dispute
any candidate that has been proposed by a validator, no matter whether it got
successfully included or even backed. Unfortunately, it would be very brittle
(no availability) and also spam protection would be way harder than for the
disputes handled by the dispute-coordinator. In fact all described spam handling
strategies above would simply be not available.</p>
<p>It is worth thinking about who could actually raise such disputes anyway:
Approval checkers certainly not, as they will only ever check once availability
succeeded. The only other nodes that meaningfully could/would are honest backing
nodes or collators. For collators spam considerations would be even worse as
there can be an unlimited number of them and we can not charge them for spam, so
trying to handle disputes raised by collators would be even more complex. For
honest backers: It actually makes more sense for them to wait until availability
is reached as well, as only then they have guarantees that other nodes will be
able to check. If they disputed before, all nodes would need to recover the data
from them, so they would be an easy DoS target.</p>
<p>In summary: The availability system was designed for raising disputes in a
meaningful and secure way after availability was reached. Trying to raise
disputes before does not meaningfully contribute to the systems security/might
even weaken it as attackers are warned before availability is reached, while at
the same time adding signficant amount of complexity. We therefore punt on such
disputes and concentrate on disputes the system was designed to handle.</p>
<h3 id="no-disputes-for-already-finalized-blocks"><a class="header" href="#no-disputes-for-already-finalized-blocks">No Disputes for Already Finalized Blocks</a></h3>
<p>Note that by above rules in the <code>Participation</code> section, we will not participate
in disputes concerning a candidate in an already finalized block. This is
because, disputing an already finalized block is simply too late and therefore
of little value. Once finalized, bridges have already processed the block for
example, so we have to assume the damage is already done. Governance has to step
in and fix what can be fixed.</p>
<p>Making disputes for already finalized blocks possible would only provide two
features:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can at least still slash attackers.</li>
<li>We can freeze the chain to some governance only mode, in an attempt to
minimize potential harm done.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both seem kind of worthwhile, although as argued above, it is likely that there
is not too much that can be done in 2 and we would likely only ending up DoSing
the whole system without much we can do. 1 can also be achieved via governance
mechanisms.</p>
<p>In any case, our focus should be making as sure as reasonably possible that any
potentially invalid block does not get finalized in the first place. Not
allowing disputing already finalized blocks actually helps a great deal with
this goal as it massively reduces the amount of candidates that can be disputed.</p>
<p>This makes attempts to overwhelm the system with disputes significantly harder
and counter measures way easier. We can limit inclusion for example (as
suggested <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5898">here</a> in case of
high dispute load. Another measure we have at our disposal is that on finality
lag block production will slow down, implicitly reducing the rate of new
candidates that can be disputed. Hence, the cutting-off of the unlimited
candidate supply of already finalized blocks, guarantees the necessary DoS
protection and ensures we can have measures in place to keep up with processing
of disputes.</p>
<p>If we allowed participation for disputes for already finalized candidates, the
above spam protection mechanisms would be insufficient/relying 100% on full and
quick disabling of spamming validators.</p>

<h2 id="starting-a-dispute"><a class="header" href="#starting-a-dispute">Starting a Dispute</a></h2>
<p>A dispute is initiated once a node sends the first <code>DisputeRequest</code> wire message,
which must contain an &quot;invalid&quot; vote and a &quot;valid&quot; vote.</p>
<p>The dispute distribution subsystem can get instructed to send that message out to
all concerned validators by means of a <code>DisputeDistributionMessage::SendDispute</code>
message. That message must contain an invalid vote from the local node and some
valid one, e.g. a backing statement.</p>
<p>We include a valid vote as well, so any node regardless of whether it is synced
with the chain or not or has seen backing/approval vote can see that there are
conflicting votes available, hence we have a valid dispute. Nodes will still
need to check whether the disputing votes are somewhat current and not some
stale ones.</p>
<h2 id="participating-in-a-dispute"><a class="header" href="#participating-in-a-dispute">Participating in a Dispute</a></h2>
<p>Upon receiving a <code>DisputeRequest</code> message, a dispute distribution will trigger the
import of the received votes via the dispute coordinator
(<code>DisputeCoordinatorMessage::ImportStatements</code>). The dispute coordinator will
take care of participating in that dispute if necessary. Once it is done, the
coordinator will send a <code>DisputeDistributionMessage::SendDispute</code> message to dispute
distribution. From here, everything is the same as for starting a dispute,
except that if the local node deemed the candidate valid, the <code>SendDispute</code>
message will contain a valid vote signed by our node and will contain the
initially received <code>Invalid</code> vote.</p>
<p>Note, that we rely on <code>dispute-coordinator</code> to check validity of a dispute for spam
protection (see below).</p>
<h2 id="sending-of-messages"><a class="header" href="#sending-of-messages">Sending of messages</a></h2>
<p>Starting and participating in a dispute are pretty similar from the perspective
of dispute distribution. Once we receive a <code>SendDispute</code> message, we try to make
sure to get the data out. We keep track of all the parachain validators that
should see the message, which are all the parachain validators of the session
where the dispute happened as they will want to participate in the dispute.  In
addition we also need to get the votes out to all authorities of the current
session (which might be the same or not and may change during the dispute).
Those authorities will not participate in the dispute, but need to see the
statements so they can include them in blocks.</p>
<h3 id="reliability"><a class="header" href="#reliability">Reliability</a></h3>
<p>We only consider a message transmitted, once we received a confirmation message.
If not, we will keep retrying getting that message out as long as the dispute is
deemed alive. To determine whether a dispute is still alive we will ask the
<code>dispute-coordinator</code> for a list of all still active disputes via a
<code>DisputeCoordinatorMessage::ActiveDisputes</code> message before each retry run. Once
a dispute is no longer live, we will clean up the state accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="order"><a class="header" href="#order">Order</a></h3>
<p>We assume <code>SendDispute</code> messages are coming in an order of importance, hence
<code>dispute-distribution</code> will make sure to send out network messages in the same
order, even on retry.</p>
<h3 id="rate-limit"><a class="header" href="#rate-limit">Rate Limit</a></h3>
<p>For spam protection (see below), we employ an artificial rate limiting on sending
out messages in order to not hit the rate limit at the receiving side, which
would result in our messages getting dropped and our reputation getting reduced.</p>
<h2 id="reception"><a class="header" href="#reception">Reception</a></h2>
<p>As we shall see the receiving side is mostly about handling spam and ensuring
the dispute-coordinator learns about disputes as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Goals for the receiving side:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get new disputes to the dispute-coordinator as fast as possible, so
prioritization can happen properly.</li>
<li>Batch votes per disputes as much as possible for good import performance.</li>
<li>Prevent malicious nodes exhausting node resources by sending lots of messages.</li>
<li>Prevent malicious nodes from sending so many messages/(fake) disputes,
preventing us from concluding good ones.</li>
<li>Limit ability of malicious nodes of delaying the vote import due to batching
logic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Goal 1 and 2 seem to be conflicting, but an easy compromise is possible: When
learning about a new dispute, we will import the vote immediately, making the
dispute coordinator aware and also getting immediate feedback on the validity.
Then if valid we can batch further incoming votes, with less time constraints as
the dispute-coordinator already knows about the dispute.</p>
<p>Goal 3 and 4 are obviously very related and both can easily be solved via rate
limiting as we shall see below. Rate limits should already be implemented at the
substrate level, but <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/7750">are not</a>
at the time of writing. But even if they were, the enforced substrate limits would
likely not be configurable and thus would still be to high for our needs as we can
rely on the following observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each honest validator will only send one message (apart from duplicates on
timeout) per candidate/dispute.</li>
<li>An honest validator needs to fully recover availability and validate the
candidate for casting a vote.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these two observations, we can conclude that honest validators will usually
not send messages at a high rate. We can therefore enforce conservative rate
limits and thus minimize harm spamming malicious nodes can have.</p>
<p>Before we dive into how rate limiting solves all spam issues elegantly, let's
discuss that honest behaviour further:</p>
<p>What about session changes? Here we might have to inform a new validator set of
lots of already existing disputes at once.</p>
<p>With observation 1) and a rate limit that is per peer, we are still good:</p>
<p>Let's assume a rate limit of one message per 200ms per sender. This means 5
messages from each validator per second. 5 messages means 5 disputes!
Conclusively, we will be able to conclude 5 disputes per second - no matter what
malicious actors are doing. This is assuming dispute messages are sent ordered,
but even if not perfectly ordered: On average it will be 5 disputes per second.</p>
<p>This is good enough! All those disputes are valid ones and will result in
slashing and disabling of validators. Let's assume all of them conclude <code>valid</code>,
and we disable validators only after 100 raised concluding valid disputes, we
would still start disabling misbehaving validators in only 20 seconds.</p>
<p>One could also think that in addition participation is expected to take longer,
which means on average we can import/conclude disputes faster than they are
generated - regardless of dispute spam. Unfortunately this is not necessarily
true: There might be parachains with very light load where recovery and
validation can be accomplished very quickly - maybe faster than we can import
those disputes.</p>
<p>This is probably an argument for not imposing a too low rate limit, although the
issue is more general: Even without any rate limit, if an attacker generates
disputes at a very high rate, nodes will be having trouble keeping participation
up, hence the problem should be mitigated at a <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5898">more fundamental
layer</a>.</p>
<p>For nodes that have been offline for a while, the same argument as for session
changes holds, but matters even less: We assume 2/3 of nodes to be online, so
even if the worst case 1/3 offline happens and they could not import votes fast
enough (as argued above, they in fact can) it would not matter for consensus.</p>
<h3 id="rate-limiting"><a class="header" href="#rate-limiting">Rate Limiting</a></h3>
<p>As suggested previously, rate limiting allows to mitigate all threats that come
from malicious actors trying to overwhelm the system in order to get away without
a slash, when it comes to dispute-distribution. In this section we will explain
how in greater detail.</p>
<p>The idea is to open a queue with limited size for each peer. We will process
incoming messages as fast as we can by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check that the sending peer is actually a valid authority - otherwise drop
message and decrease reputation/disconnect.</li>
<li>Put message on the peer's queue, if queue is full - drop it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Every <code>RATE_LIMIT</code> seconds (or rather milliseconds), we pause processing
incoming requests to go a full circle and process one message from each queue.
Processing means <code>Batching</code> as explained in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="batching"><a class="header" href="#batching">Batching</a></h3>
<p>To achieve goal 2 we will batch incoming votes/messages together before passing
them on as a single batch to the <code>dispute-coordinator</code>. To adhere to goal 1 as
well, we will do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>For an incoming message, we check whether we have an existing batch for that
candidate, if not we import directly to the dispute-coordinator, as we have
to assume this is concerning a new dispute.</li>
<li>We open a batch and start collecting incoming messages for that candidate,
instead of immediately forwarding.</li>
<li>We keep collecting votes in the batch until we receive less than
<code>MIN_KEEP_BATCH_ALIVE_VOTES</code> unique votes in the last <code>BATCH_COLLECTING_INTERVAL</code>. This is
important to accommodate for goal 5 and also 3.</li>
<li>We send the whole batch to the dispute-coordinator.</li>
</ol>
<p>This together with rate limiting explained above ensures we will be able to
process valid disputes: We can limit the number of simultaneous existing batches
to some high value, but can be rather certain that this limit will never be
reached - hence we won't drop valid disputes:</p>
<p>Let's assume <code>MIN_KEEP_BATCH_ALIVE_VOTES</code> is 10, <code>BATCH_COLLECTING_INTERVAL</code>
is <code>500ms</code> and above <code>RATE_LIMIT</code> is <code>100ms</code>. 1/3 of validators are malicious,
so for 1000 this means around 330 malicious actors worst case.</p>
<p>All those actors can send a message every <code>100ms</code>, that is 10 per second. This
means at the begining of an attack they can open up around 3300 batches. Each
containing two votes. So memory usage is still negligible. In reality it is even
less, as we also demand 10 new votes to trickle in per batch in order to keep it
alive, every <code>500ms</code>. Hence for the first second, each batch requires 20 votes
each. Each message is 2 votes, so this means 10 messages per batch. Hence to
keep those batches alive 10 attackers are needed for each batch. This reduces
the number of opened batches by a factor of 10: So we only have 330 batches in 1
second - each containing 20 votes.</p>
<p>The next second: In order to further grow memory usage, attackers have to
maintain 10 messages per batch and second. Number of batches equals the number
of attackers, each has 10 messages per second, all are needed to maintain the
batches in memory. Therefore we have a hard cap of around 330 (number of
malicious nodes) open batches. Each can be filled with number of malicious
actor's votes. So 330 batches with each 330 votes: Let's assume approximately 100
bytes per signature/vote. This results in a worst case memory usage of 330 * 330</p>
<ul>
<li>100 ~= 10 MiB.</li>
</ul>
<p>For 10_000 validators, we are already in the Gigabyte range, which means that
with a validator set that large we might want to be more strict with the rate limit or
require a larger rate of incoming votes per batch to keep them alive.</p>
<p>For a thousand validators a limit on batches of around 1000 should never be
reached in practice. Hence due to rate limiting we have a very good chance to
not ever having to drop a potential valid dispute due to some resource limit.</p>
<p>Further safe guards are possible: The dispute-coordinator actually
confirms/denies imports. So once we receive a denial by the dispute-coordinator
for the initial imported votes, we can opt into flushing the batch immediately
and importing the votes. This swaps memory usage for more CPU usage, but if that
import is deemed invalid again we can immediately decrease the reputation of the
sending peers, so this should be a net win. For the time being we punt on this
for simplicity.</p>
<p>Instead of filling batches to maximize memory usage, attackers could also try to
overwhelm the dispute coordinator by only sending votes for new candidates all
the time. This attack vector is mitigated also by above rate limit and
decreasing the peer's reputation on denial of the invalid imports by the
coordinator.</p>
<h3 id="node-startup"><a class="header" href="#node-startup">Node Startup</a></h3>
<p>On startup we need to check with the dispute coordinator for any ongoing
disputes and assume we have not yet sent our statement for those. In case we
find an explicit statement from ourselves via
<code>DisputeCoordinatorMessage::QueryCandidateVotes</code> we will pretend to just have
received a <code>SendDispute</code> message for that candidate.</p>
<h2 id="backing-and-approval-votes"><a class="header" href="#backing-and-approval-votes">Backing and Approval Votes</a></h2>
<p>Backing and approval votes get imported when they arrive/are created via the
dispute coordinator by corresponding subsystems.</p>
<p>We assume that under normal operation each node will be aware of backing and
approval votes and optimize for that case. Nevertheless we want disputes to
conclude fast and reliable, therefore if a node is not aware of backing/approval
votes it can request the missing votes from the node that informed it about the
dispute (see <a href="node/disputes/dispute-distribution.html#Resiliency%5D">Resiliency</a></p>
<h2 id="resiliency"><a class="header" href="#resiliency">Resiliency</a></h2>
<p>The above protocol should be sufficient for most cases, but there are certain
cases we also want to have covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non validator nodes might be interested in ongoing voting, even before it is
recorded on chain.</li>
<li>Nodes might have missed votes, especially backing or approval votes.
Recovering them from chain is difficult and expensive, due to runtime upgrades
and untyped extrinsics.</li>
<li>More importantly, on era changes the new authority set, from the perspective
of approval-voting have no need to see &quot;old&quot; approval votes, hence they might
not see them, can therefore not import them into the dispute coordinator and
therefore no authority will put them on chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>To cover those cases, we introduce a second request/response protocol, which can
be handled on a lower priority basis as the one above. It consists of the
request/response messages as described in the [protocol
section][#vote-recovery].</p>
<p>Nodes may send those requests to validators, if they feel they are missing
votes. E.g. after some timeout, if no majority was reached yet in their point of
view or if they are not aware of any backing/approval votes for a received
disputed candidate.</p>
<p>The receiver of a <code>IHaveVotesRequest</code> message will do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>See if the sender is missing votes we are aware of - if so, respond with
those votes.</li>
<li>Check whether the sender knows about any votes, we don't know about and if so
send a <code>IHaveVotesRequest</code> request back, with our knowledge.</li>
<li>Record the peer's knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>When to send <code>IHaveVotesRequest</code> messages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whenever we are asked to do so via
<code>DisputeDistributionMessage::FetchMissingVotes</code>.</li>
<li>Approximately once per block to some random validator as long as the dispute
is active.</li>
</ol>
<p>Spam considerations: Nodes want to accept those messages once per validator and
per slot. They are free to drop more frequent requests or requests for stale
data. Requests coming from non validator nodes, can be handled on a best effort
basis.</p>
<h2 id="considerations"><a class="header" href="#considerations">Considerations</a></h2>
<p>Dispute distribution is critical. We should keep track of available validator
connections and issue warnings if we are not connected to a majority of
validators. We should also keep track of failed sending attempts and log
warnings accordingly. As disputes are rare and TCP is a reliable protocol,
probably each failed attempt should trigger a warning in logs and also logged
into some Prometheus metric.</p>
<h2 id="disputes-for-non-available-candidates"><a class="header" href="#disputes-for-non-available-candidates">Disputes for non available candidates</a></h2>
<p>If deemed necessary we can later on also support disputes for non available
candidates, but disputes for those cases have totally different requirements.</p>
<p>First of all such disputes are not time critical. We just want to have
some offender slashed at some point, but we have no risk of finalizing any bad
data.</p>
<p>Second, as we won't have availability for such data, the node that initiated the
dispute will be responsible for providing the disputed data initially. Then
nodes which did the check already are also providers of the data, hence
distributing load and making prevention of the dispute from concluding harder
and harder over time. Assuming an attacker can not DoS a node forever, the
dispute will succeed eventually, which is all that matters. And again, even if
an attacker managed to prevent such a dispute from happening somehow, there is
no real harm done: There was no serious attack to begin with.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="availability-store"><a class="header" href="#availability-store">Availability Store</a></h1>
<p>This is a utility subsystem responsible for keeping available certain data and pruning that data.</p>
<p>The two data types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full PoV blocks of candidates we have validated</li>
<li>Availability chunks of candidates that were backed and noted available on-chain.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of these data we have pruning rules that determine how long we need to keep that data available.</p>
<p>PoV hypothetically only need to be kept around until the block where the data was made fully available is finalized. However, disputes can revert finality, so we need to be a bit more conservative and we add a delay. We should keep the PoV until a block that finalized availability of it has been finalized for 1 day + 1 hour.</p>
<p>Availability chunks need to be kept available until the dispute period for the corresponding candidate has ended. We can accomplish this by using the same criterion as the above. This gives us a pruning condition of the block finalizing availability of the chunk being final for 1 day + 1 hour.</p>
<p>There is also the case where a validator commits to make a PoV available, but the corresponding candidate is never backed. In this case, we keep the PoV available for 1 hour.</p>
<p>There may be multiple competing blocks all ending the availability phase for a particular candidate. Until finality, it will be unclear which of those is actually the canonical chain, so the pruning records for PoVs and Availability chunks should keep track of all such blocks.</p>

<h2 id="database-schema-2"><a class="header" href="#database-schema-2">Database Schema</a></h2>
<p>We use an underlying Key-Value database where we assume we have the following operations available:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>write(key, value)</code></li>
<li><code>read(key) -&gt; Option&lt;value&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>iter_with_prefix(prefix) -&gt; Iterator&lt;(key, value)&gt;</code> - gives all keys and values in lexicographical order where the key starts with <code>prefix</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this database to encode the following schema:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>(&quot;available&quot;, CandidateHash) -&gt; Option&lt;AvailableData&gt;
(&quot;chunk&quot;, CandidateHash, u32) -&gt; Option&lt;ErasureChunk&gt;
(&quot;meta&quot;, CandidateHash) -&gt; Option&lt;CandidateMeta&gt;

(&quot;unfinalized&quot;, BlockNumber, BlockHash, CandidateHash) -&gt; Option&lt;()&gt;
(&quot;prune_by_time&quot;, Timestamp, CandidateHash) -&gt; Option&lt;()&gt;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Timestamps are the wall-clock seconds since Unix epoch. Timestamps and block numbers are both encoded as big-endian so lexicographic order is ascending.</p>
<p>The meta information that we track per-candidate is defined as the <code>CandidateMeta</code> struct</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct CandidateMeta {
  state: State,
  data_available: bool,
  chunks_stored: Bitfield,
}

enum State {
  /// Candidate data was first observed at the given time but is not available in any block.
  Unavailable(Timestamp),
  /// The candidate was first observed at the given time and was included in the given list of unfinalized blocks, which may be
  /// empty. The timestamp here is not used for pruning. Either one of these blocks will be finalized or the state will regress to
  /// `State::Unavailable`, in which case the same timestamp will be reused.
  Unfinalized(Timestamp, Vec&lt;(BlockNumber, BlockHash)&gt;),
  /// Candidate data has appeared in a finalized block and did so at the given time.
  Finalized(Timestamp)
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We maintain the invariant that if a candidate has a meta entry, its available data exists on disk if <code>data_available</code> is true. All chunks mentioned in the meta entry are available.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is exactly one <code>prune_by_time</code> entry which holds the candidate hash unless the state is <code>Unfinalized</code>. There may be zero, one, or many &quot;unfinalized&quot; keys with the given candidate, and this will correspond to the <code>state</code> of the meta entry.</p>

<p>This subsystem is responsible for handling candidate validation requests. It is a simple request/response server.</p>
<p>A variety of subsystems want to know if a parachain block candidate is valid. None of them care about the detailed mechanics of how a candidate gets validated, just the results. This subsystem handles those details.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-13"><a class="header" href="#protocol-13">Protocol</a></h2>
<p>Input: <a href="node/utility/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#validation-request-type"><code>CandidateValidationMessage</code></a></p>
<p>Output: Validation result via the provided response side-channel.</p>
<h2 id="functionality-12"><a class="header" href="#functionality-12">Functionality</a></h2>
<p>This subsystem groups the requests it handles in two categories:  <em>candidate validation</em> and <em>PVF pre-checking</em>. </p>
<p>The first category can be further subdivided in two request types: one which draws out validation data from the state, and another which accepts all validation data exhaustively. Validation returns three possible outcomes on the response channel: the candidate is valid, the candidate is invalid, or an internal error occurred. </p>
<p>Parachain candidates are validated against their validation function: A piece of Wasm code that describes the state-transition of the parachain. Validation function execution is not metered. This means that an execution which is an infinite loop or simply takes too long must be forcibly exited by some other means. For this reason, we recommend dispatching candidate validation to be done on subprocesses which can be killed if they time-out.</p>
<p>Upon receiving a validation request, the first thing the candidate validation subsystem should do is make sure it has all the necessary parameters to the validation function. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Validation Function itself.</li>
<li>The <a href="node/utility/../../types/candidate.html#candidatedescriptor"><code>CandidateDescriptor</code></a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="node/utility/../../types/candidate.html#validationdata"><code>ValidationData</code></a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="node/utility/../../types/availability.html#proofofvalidity"><code>PoV</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second category is for PVF pre-checking. This is primarly used by the <a href="node/utility/pvf-prechecker.html">PVF pre-checker</a> subsystem.</p>
<h3 id="determining-parameters"><a class="header" href="#determining-parameters">Determining Parameters</a></h3>
<p>For a <a href="node/utility/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#validationrequesttype"><code>CandidateValidationMessage</code></a><code>::ValidateFromExhaustive</code>, these parameters are exhaustively provided.</p>
<p>For a <a href="node/utility/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#validationrequesttype"><code>CandidateValidationMessage</code></a><code>::ValidateFromChainState</code>, some more work needs to be done. Due to the uncertainty of Availability Cores (implemented in the <a href="node/utility/../../runtime/scheduler.html"><code>Scheduler</code></a> module of the runtime), a candidate at a particular relay-parent and for a particular para may have two different valid validation-data to be executed under depending on what is assumed to happen if the para is occupying a core at the onset of the new block. This is encoded as an <code>OccupiedCoreAssumption</code> in the runtime API.</p>
<p>The way that we can determine which assumption the candidate is meant to be executed under is simply to do an exhaustive check of both possibilities based on the state of the relay-parent. First we fetch the validation data under the assumption that the block occupying becomes available. If the <code>validation_data_hash</code> of the <code>CandidateDescriptor</code> matches this validation data, we use that. Otherwise, if the <code>validation_data_hash</code> matches the validation data fetched under the <code>TimedOut</code> assumption, we use that. Otherwise, we return a <code>ValidationResult::Invalid</code> response and conclude.</p>
<p>Then, we can fetch the validation code from the runtime based on which type of candidate this is. This gives us all the parameters. The descriptor and PoV come from the request itself, and the other parameters have been derived from the state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODO: This would be a great place for caching to avoid making lots of runtime requests. That would need a job, though.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="execution-of-the-parachain-wasm"><a class="header" href="#execution-of-the-parachain-wasm">Execution of the Parachain Wasm</a></h3>
<p>Once we have all parameters, we can spin up a background task to perform the validation in a way that doesn't hold up the entire event loop. Before invoking the validation function itself, this should first do some basic checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The collator signature is valid</li>
<li>The PoV provided matches the <code>pov_hash</code> field of the descriptor</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="checking-validation-outputs"><a class="header" href="#checking-validation-outputs">Checking Validation Outputs</a></h3>
<p>If we can assume the presence of the relay-chain state (that is, during processing <a href="node/utility/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#validationrequesttype"><code>CandidateValidationMessage</code></a><code>::ValidateFromChainState</code>) we can run all the checks that the relay-chain would run at the inclusion time thus confirming that the candidate will be accepted.</p>

<p>Relay chain block authorship authority is governed by BABE and is beyond the scope of the Overseer and the rest of the subsystems. That said, ultimately the block author needs to select a set of backable parachain candidates and other consensus data, and assemble a block from them. This subsystem is responsible for providing the necessary data to all potential block authors.</p>
<p>A major feature of the provisioner: this subsystem is responsible for ensuring that parachain block candidates are sufficiently available before sending them to potential block authors.</p>
<h2 id="provisionable-data"><a class="header" href="#provisionable-data">Provisionable Data</a></h2>
<p>There are several distinct types of provisionable data, but they share this property in common: all should eventually be included in a relay chain block.</p>
<h3 id="backed-candidates"><a class="header" href="#backed-candidates">Backed Candidates</a></h3>
<p>The block author can choose 0 or 1 backed parachain candidates per parachain; the only constraint is that each backed candidate has the appropriate relay parent. However, the choice of a backed candidate must be the block author's; the provisioner must ensure that block authors are aware of all available <a href="node/utility/../../types/backing.html#backed-candidate"><code>BackedCandidate</code>s</a>.</p>
<h3 id="signed-bitfields"><a class="header" href="#signed-bitfields">Signed Bitfields</a></h3>
<p><a href="node/utility/../../types/availability.html#signed-availability-bitfield">Signed bitfields</a> are attestations from a particular validator about which candidates it believes are available. Those will only be provided on fresh leaves.</p>
<h3 id="misbehavior-reports"><a class="header" href="#misbehavior-reports">Misbehavior Reports</a></h3>
<p>Misbehavior reports are self-contained proofs of misbehavior by a validator or group of validators. For example, it is very easy to verify a double-voting misbehavior report: the report contains two votes signed by the same key, advocating different outcomes. Concretely, misbehavior reports become inherents which cause dots to be slashed.</p>
<p>Note that there is no mechanism in place which forces a block author to include a misbehavior report which it doesn't like, for example if it would be slashed by such a report. The chain's defense against this is to have a relatively long slash period, such that it's likely to encounter an honest author before the slash period expires.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-inherent"><a class="header" href="#dispute-inherent">Dispute Inherent</a></h3>
<p>The dispute inherent is similar to a misbehavior report in that it is an attestation of misbehavior on the part of a validator or group of validators. Unlike a misbehavior report, it is not self-contained: resolution requires coordinated action by several validators. The canonical example of a dispute inherent involves an approval checker discovering that a set of validators has improperly approved an invalid parachain block: resolving this requires the entire validator set to re-validate the block, so that the minority can be slashed.</p>
<p>Dispute resolution is complex and is explained in substantially more detail <a href="node/utility/../../runtime/disputes.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-14"><a class="header" href="#protocol-14">Protocol</a></h2>
<p>Input: <a href="node/utility/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#provisioner-message"><code>ProvisionerMessage</code></a>. Backed candidates come from the <a href="node/utility/../backing/candidate-backing.html">Candidate Backing subsystem</a>, signed bitfields come from the <a href="node/utility/../availability/bitfield-distribution.html">Bitfield Distribution subsystem</a>, and misbehavior reports and disputes come from the <a href="node/utility/misbehavior-arbitration.html">Misbehavior Arbitration subsystem</a>.</p>
<p>At initialization, this subsystem has no outputs.</p>
<p>Block authors request the inherent data they should use for constructing the inherent in the block which contains parachain execution information.</p>
<h2 id="block-production"><a class="header" href="#block-production">Block Production</a></h2>
<p>When a validator is selected by BABE to author a block, it becomes a block producer. The provisioner is the subsystem best suited to choosing which specific backed candidates and availability bitfields should be assembled into the block. To engage this functionality, a <code>ProvisionerMessage::RequestInherentData</code> is sent; the response is a <a href="node/utility/../../types/runtime.html#parainherentdata"><code>ParaInherentData</code></a>. There are never two distinct parachain candidates included for the same parachain and that new parachain candidates cannot be backed until the previous one either gets declared available or expired. Appropriate bitfields, as outlined in the section on <a href="node/utility/provisioner.html#bitfield-selection">bitfield selection</a>, and any dispute statements should be attached as well.</p>
<h3 id="bitfield-selection"><a class="header" href="#bitfield-selection">Bitfield Selection</a></h3>
<p>Our goal with respect to bitfields is simple: maximize availability. However, it's not quite as simple as always including all bitfields; there are constraints which still need to be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>We cannot choose more than one bitfield per validator.</li>
<li>Each bitfield must correspond to an occupied core.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that, a semi-arbitrary selection policy is fine. In order to meet the goal of maximizing availability, a heuristic of picking the bitfield with the greatest number of 1 bits set in the event of conflict is useful.</p>
<h3 id="candidate-selection"><a class="header" href="#candidate-selection">Candidate Selection</a></h3>
<p>The goal of candidate selection is to determine which cores are free, and then to the degree possible, pick a candidate appropriate to each free core.</p>
<p>To determine availability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the list of core states from the runtime API</li>
<li>For each core state:
<ul>
<li>On <code>CoreState::Scheduled</code>, then we can make an <code>OccupiedCoreAssumption::Free</code>.</li>
<li>On <code>CoreState::Occupied</code>, then we may be able to make an assumption:
<ul>
<li>If the bitfields indicate availability and there is a scheduled <code>next_up_on_available</code>, then we can make an <code>OccupiedCoreAssumption::Included</code>.</li>
<li>If the bitfields do not indicate availability, and there is a scheduled <code>next_up_on_time_out</code>, and <code>occupied_core.time_out_at == block_number_under_production</code>, then we can make an <code>OccupiedCoreAssumption::TimedOut</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we did not make an <code>OccupiedCoreAssumption</code>, then continue on to the next core.</li>
<li>Now compute the core's <code>validation_data_hash</code>: get the <code>PersistedValidationData</code> from the runtime, given the known <code>ParaId</code> and <code>OccupiedCoreAssumption</code>;</li>
<li>Find an appropriate candidate for the core.
<ul>
<li>There are two constraints: <code>backed_candidate.candidate.descriptor.para_id == scheduled_core.para_id &amp;&amp; candidate.candidate.descriptor.validation_data_hash == computed_validation_data_hash</code>.</li>
<li>In the event that more than one candidate meets the constraints, selection between the candidates is arbitrary. However, not more than one candidate can be selected per core.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The end result of this process is a vector of <code>BackedCandidate</code>s, sorted in order of their core index. Furthermore, this process should select at maximum one candidate which upgrades the runtime validation code.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-statement-selection"><a class="header" href="#dispute-statement-selection">Dispute Statement Selection</a></h3>
<p>This is the point at which the block author provides further votes to active disputes or initiates new disputes in the runtime state.</p>
<p>The block-authoring logic of the runtime has an extra step between handling the inherent-data and producing the actual inherent call, which we assume performs the work of filtering out disputes which are not relevant to the on-chain state.</p>
<p>To select disputes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue a <code>DisputeCoordinatorMessage::RecentDisputes</code> message and wait for the response. This is a set of all disputes in recent sessions which we are aware of.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="determining-bitfield-availability"><a class="header" href="#determining-bitfield-availability">Determining Bitfield Availability</a></h3>
<p>An occupied core has a <code>CoreAvailability</code> bitfield. We also have a list of <code>SignedAvailabilityBitfield</code>s. We need to determine from these whether or not a core at a particular index has become available.</p>
<p>The key insight required is that <code>CoreAvailability</code> is transverse to the <code>SignedAvailabilityBitfield</code>s: if we conceptualize the list of bitfields as many rows, each bit of which is its own column, then <code>CoreAvailability</code> for a given core index is the vertical slice of bits in the set at that index.</p>
<p>To compute bitfield availability, then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a copy of <code>OccupiedCore.availability</code></li>
<li>For each bitfield in the list of <code>SignedAvailabilityBitfield</code>s:
<ul>
<li>Get the bitfield's <code>validator_index</code></li>
<li>Update the availability. Conceptually, assuming bit vectors: <code>availability[validator_index] |= bitfield[core_idx]</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Availability has a 2/3 threshold. Therefore: <code>3 * availability.count_ones() &gt;= 2 * availability.len()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>One of the main features of the overseer/subsystem duality is to avoid shared ownership of resources and to communicate via message-passing. However, implementing each networking subsystem as its own network protocol brings a fair share of challenges.</p>
<p>The most notable challenge is coordinating and eliminating race conditions of peer connection and disconnection events. If we have many network protocols that peers are supposed to be connected on, it is difficult to enforce that a peer is indeed connected on all of them or the order in which those protocols receive notifications that peers have connected. This becomes especially difficult when attempting to share peer state across protocols. All of the Parachain-Host's gossip protocols eliminate DoS with a data-dependency on current chain heads. However, it is inefficient and confusing to implement the logic for tracking our current chain heads as well as our peers' on each of those subsystems. Having one subsystem for tracking this shared state and distributing it to the others is an improvement in architecture and efficiency.</p>
<p>One other piece of shared state to track is peer reputation. When peers are found to have provided value or cost, we adjust their reputation accordingly.</p>
<p>So in short, this Subsystem acts as a bridge between an actual network component and a subsystem's protocol. The implementation of the underlying network component is beyond the scope of this module. We make certain assumptions about the network component:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network allows registering of protocols and multiple versions of each protocol.</li>
<li>The network handles version negotiation of protocols with peers and only connects the peer on the highest version of the protocol.</li>
<li>Each protocol has its own peer-set, although there may be some overlap.</li>
<li>The network provides peer-set management utilities for discovering the peer-IDs of validators and a means of dialing peers with given IDs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The network bridge makes use of the peer-set feature, but is not generic over peer-set. Instead, it exposes two peer-sets that event producers can attach to: <code>Validation</code> and <code>Collation</code>. More information can be found on the documentation of the <a href="node/utility/../../types/overseer-protocol.html#network-bridge-message"><code>NetworkBridgeMessage</code></a>.</p>

<p>The Gossip Support Subsystem is responsible for keeping track of session changes
and issuing a connection request to all validators in the next, current and
a few past sessions if we are a validator in these sessions.
The request will add all validators to a reserved PeerSet, meaning we will not
reject a connection request from any validator in that set.</p>
<p>In addition to that, it creates a gossip overlay topology per session which
limits the amount of messages sent and received to be an order of sqrt of the
validators. Our neighbors in this graph will be forwarded to the network bridge
with the <code>NetworkBridgeMessage::NewGossipTopology</code> message.</p>
<p>See https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/3239 for more details.</p>
<p>The gossip topology is used by parachain distribution subsystems,
such as Bitfield Distribution, (small) Statement Distribution and
Approval Distribution to limit the amount of peers we send messages to

<p>This subsystem implements the necessary metadata for the implementation of the <a href="node/utility/../../protocol-chain-selection.html">chain selection</a> portion of the protocol.</p>
<p>The subsystem wraps a database component which maintains a view of the unfinalized chain and records the properties of each block: whether the block is <strong>viable</strong>, whether it is <strong>stagnant</strong>, and whether it is <strong>reverted</strong>. It should also maintain an updated set of active leaves in accordance with this view, which should be cheap to query. Leaves are ordered descending first by weight and then by block number.</p>
<p>This subsystem needs to update its information on the unfinalized chain:</p>
<ul>
<li>On every leaf-activated signal</li>
<li>On every block-finalized signal</li>
<li>On every <code>ChainSelectionMessage::Approve</code></li>
<li>Periodically, to detect stagnation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple implementations of these updates do <code>O(n_unfinalized_blocks)</code> disk operations. If the amount of unfinalized blocks is relatively small, the updates should not take very much time. However, in cases where there are hundreds or thousands of unfinalized blocks the naive implementations of these update algorithms would have to be replaced with more sophisticated versions.</p>

<p>The PVF pre-checker is a subsystem that is responsible for watching the relay chain for new PVFs that require pre-checking. Head over to <a href="node/utility/../../pvf-prechecking.html">overview</a> for the PVF pre-checking process overview.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-19"><a class="header" href="#protocol-19">Protocol</a></h2>
<p>There is no dedicated input mechanism for PVF pre-checker. Instead, PVF pre-checker looks on the <code>ActiveLeavesUpdate</code> event stream for work.</p>
<p>This subsytem does not produce any output messages either. The subsystem will, however, send messages to the <a href="node/utility/runtime-api.html">Runtime API</a> subsystem to query for the pending PVFs and to submit votes. In addition to that, it will also communicate with <a href="node/utility/candidate-validation.html">Candidate Validation</a> Subsystem to request PVF pre-check.</p>
<h2 id="functionality-18"><a class="header" href="#functionality-18">Functionality</a></h2>
<p>If the node is running in a collator mode, this subsystem will be disabled. The PVF pre-checker subsystem keeps track of the PVFs that are relevant for the subsystem. </p>
<p>To be relevant for the subsystem, a PVF must be returned by <code>pvfs_require_precheck</code> <a href="node/utility/../../runtime-api/pvf-prechecking.html"><code>pvfs_require_precheck</code> runtime API</a> in any of the active leaves. If the PVF is not present in any of the active leaves, it ceases to be relevant.</p>
<p>When a PVF just becomes relevant, the subsystem will send a message to the <a href="node/utility/candidate-validation.html">Candidate Validation</a> subsystem asking for the pre-check.</p>
<p>Upon receving a message from the candidate-validation subsystem, the pre-checker will note down that the PVF has its judgement and will also sign and submit a <a href="node/utility/../../types/pvf-prechecking.html"><code>PvfCheckStatement</code></a> via the <a href="node/utility/../../runtime-api/pvf-prechecking.html"><code>submit_pvf_check_statement</code> runtime API</a>. In case, a judgement was received for a PVF that is no longer in view it is ignored. It is possible that the candidate validation was not able to check the PVF. In that case, the PVF pre-checker will abstain and won't submit any check statements.</p>
<p>Since a vote only is valid during <a href="node/utility/../../pvf-prechecking.html">one session</a>, the subsystem will have to resign and submit the statements for for the new session. The new session is assumed to be started if at least one of the leaves has a greater session index that was previously observed in any of the leaves.</p>
<p>The subsystem tracks all the statement that it submitted within a session. If for some reason a PVF became irrelevant and then becomes relevant again, the subsystem will not submit a new statement for that PVF within the same session.</p>
<p>If the node is not in the active validator set, it will still perform all the checks. However, it will only submit the check statements when the node is in the active validator set.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="candidate-types"><a class="header" href="#candidate-types">Candidate Types</a></h1>
<p>Para candidates are some of the most common types, both within the runtime and on the Node-side.
Candidates are the fundamental datatype for advancing parachains and parathreads, encapsulating the collator's signature, the context of the parablock, the commitments to the output, and a commitment to the data which proves it valid.</p>
<p>In a way, this entire guide is about these candidates: how they are scheduled, constructed, backed, included, and challenged.</p>
<p>This section will describe the base candidate type, its components, and variants that contain extra data.</p>
<h2 id="para-id"><a class="header" href="#para-id">Para Id</a></h2>
<p>A unique 32-bit identifier referring to a specific para (chain or thread). The relay-chain runtime guarantees that <code>ParaId</code>s are unique for the duration of any session, but recycling and reuse over a longer period of time is permitted.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct ParaId(u32);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="candidate-receipt"><a class="header" href="#candidate-receipt">Candidate Receipt</a></h2>
<p>Much info in a <a href="types/candidate.html#full-candidate-receipt"><code>FullCandidateReceipt</code></a> is duplicated from the relay-chain state. When the corresponding relay-chain state is considered widely available, the Candidate Receipt should be favored over the <code>FullCandidateReceipt</code>.</p>
<p>Examples of situations where the state is readily available includes within the scope of work done by subsystems working on a given relay-parent, or within the logic of the runtime importing a backed candidate.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>/// A candidate-receipt.
struct CandidateReceipt {
	/// The descriptor of the candidate.
	descriptor: CandidateDescriptor,
	/// The hash of the encoded commitments made as a result of candidate execution.
	commitments_hash: Hash,
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="full-candidate-receipt"><a class="header" href="#full-candidate-receipt">Full Candidate Receipt</a></h2>
<p>This is the full receipt type. The <code>PersistedValidationData</code> are technically redundant with the <code>inner.relay_parent</code>, which uniquely describes the block in the blockchain from whose state these values are derived. The <a href="types/candidate.html#candidate-receipt"><code>CandidateReceipt</code></a> variant is often used instead for this reason.</p>
<p>However, the Full Candidate Receipt type is useful as a means of avoiding the implicit dependency on availability of old blockchain state. In situations such as availability and approval, having the full description of the candidate within a self-contained struct is convenient.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

struct FullCandidateReceipt {

}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="committed-candidate-receipt"><a class="header" href="#committed-candidate-receipt">Committed Candidate Receipt</a></h2>
<p>This is a variant of the candidate receipt which includes the commitments of the candidate receipt alongside the descriptor. This should be favored over the <a href="types/candidate.html#candidate-receipt"><code>Candidate Receipt</code></a> in situations where the candidate is not going to be executed but the actual data committed to is important. This is often the case in the backing phase.</p>
<p>The hash of the committed candidate receipt will be the same as the corresponding <a href="types/candidate.html#candidate-receipt"><code>Candidate Receipt</code></a>, because it is computed by first hashing the encoding of the commitments to form a plain <a href="types/candidate.html#candidate-receipt"><code>Candidate Receipt</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="persistedvalidationdata"><a class="header" href="#persistedvalidationdata"><code>PersistedValidationData</code></a></h2>
<p>The validation data provides information about how to create the inputs for validation of a candidate. This information is derived from the chain state and will vary from para to para, although some of the fields may be the same for every para.</p>
<p>Since this data is used to form inputs to the validation function, it needs to be persisted by the availability system to avoid dependence on availability of the relay-chain state.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the validation data acts as a way to authorize the additional data the collator needs to pass to the validation function. For example, the validation function can check whether the incoming messages (e.g. downward messages) were actually sent by using the data provided in the validation data using so called MQC heads.</p>
<p>Since the commitments of the validation function are checked by the relay-chain, secondary checkers can rely on the invariant that the relay-chain only includes para-blocks for which these checks have already been done. As such, there is no need for the validation data used to inform validators and collators about the checks the relay-chain will perform to be persisted by the availability system.</p>
<p>The <code>PersistedValidationData</code> should be relatively lightweight primarily because it is constructed during inclusion for each candidate and therefore lies on the critical path of inclusion.</p>

<p>Note the presence of the <a href="types/../types/candidate.html#signing-context"><code>SigningContext</code></a> in the signatures of the <code>sign</code> and <code>validate</code> methods. To ensure cryptographic security, the actual signed payload is always the SCALE encoding of <code>(payload.into(), signing_context)</code>. Including the signing context prevents replay attacks.</p>
<p><code>EncodeAs</code> is a helper trait with a blanket impl which ensures that any <code>T</code> can <code>EncodeAs&lt;T&gt;</code>. Therefore, for the generic case where <code>RealPayload = Payload</code>, it changes nothing.

<p>All subsystems have their own message types; all of them need to be able to listen for overseer signals as well. There are currently two proposals for how to handle that with unified communication channels:</p>
<ol>
<li>Retaining the <code>OverseerSignal</code> definition above, add <code>enum FromOrchestra&lt;T&gt; {Signal(OverseerSignal), Message(T)}</code>.</li>
<li>Add a generic varint to <code>OverseerSignal</code>: <code>Message(T)</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Either way, there will be some top-level type encapsulating messages from the overseer to each subsystem.</p>

<li><strong>DMP:</strong> (Downward Message Passing). Message passing from the relay-chain to a parachain. Also there is a runtime parachains module with the same name.</li>
<li><strong>DMQ:</strong> (Downward Message Queue). A message queue for messages from the relay-chain down to a parachain. A parachain has
exactly one downward message queue.</li>
<li><strong>Extrinsic:</strong> An element of a relay-chain block which triggers a specific entry-point of a runtime module with given arguments.</li>
<li><strong>GRANDPA:</strong> (Ghost-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement). The algorithm validators use to guarantee finality of the Relay Chain.</li>
<li><strong>HRMP:</strong> (Horizontally Relay-routed Message Passing). A mechanism for message passing between parachains (hence horizontal) that leverages the relay-chain storage. Predates XCMP. Also there is a runtime parachains module with the same name.</li>
<li><strong>Inclusion Pipeline:</strong> The set of steps taken to carry a Parachain Candidate from authoring, to backing, to availability and full inclusion in an active fork of its parachain.</li>
<li><strong>Module:</strong> A component of the Runtime logic, encapsulating storage, routines, and entry-points.</li>
<li><strong>Module Entry Point:</strong> A recipient of new information presented to the Runtime. This may trigger routines.</li>
<li><strong>Module Routine:</strong> A piece of code executed within a module by block initialization, closing, or upon an entry point being triggered. This may execute computation, and read or write storage.</li>
<li><strong>MQC:</strong> (Message Queue Chain). A cryptographic data structure that resembles an append-only linked list which doesn't store original values but only their hashes. The whole structure is described by a single hash, referred as a &quot;head&quot;. When a value is appended, it's contents hashed with the previous head creating a hash that becomes a new head.</li>
<li><strong>Node:</strong> A participant in the Polkadot network, who follows the protocols of communication and connection to other nodes. Nodes form a peer-to-peer network topology without a central authority.</li>
<li><strong>Parachain Candidate, or Candidate:</strong> A proposed block for inclusion into a parachain.</li>
<li><strong>Parablock:</strong> A block in a parachain.</li>
<li><strong>Parachain:</strong> A constituent chain secured by the Relay Chain's validators.</li>
<li><strong>Parachain Validators:</strong> A subset of validators assigned during a period of time to back candidates for a specific parachain</li>
<li><strong>Parathread:</strong> A parachain which is scheduled on a pay-as-you-go basis.</li>
<li><strong>PDK (Parachain Development Kit):</strong> A toolset that allows one to develop a parachain. Cumulus is a PDK.</li>
<li><strong>Preimage:</strong> In our context, if <code>H(X) = Y</code> where <code>H</code> is a hash function and <code>Y</code> is the hash, then <code>X</code> is the hash preimage.</li>
<li><strong>Proof-of-Validity (PoV):</strong> A stateless-client proof that a parachain candidate is valid, with respect to some validation function.</li>
<li><strong>PVF:</strong> Parachain Validation Function. The validation code that is run by validators on parachains or parathreads.</li>
<li><strong>PVF Prechecking:</strong> This is the process of initially checking the PVF when it is first added. We attempt preparation of the PVF and make sure it succeeds within a given timeout.</li>
<li><strong>PVF Preparation:</strong> This is the process of preparing the WASM blob and includes both prevalidation and compilation. As prevalidation is pretty minimal right now, preparation mostly consists of compilation.</li>
<li><strong>Relay Parent:</strong> A block in the relay chain, referred to in a context where work is being done in the context of the state at this block.</li>
<li><strong>Router:</strong> The router module is a meta module that consists of three runtime modules responsible for routing messages between paras and the relay chain. The three separate runtime modules are: Dmp, Ump, Hrmp, each responsible for the respective part of message routing.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime:</strong> The relay-chain state machine.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime Module:</strong> See Module.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime API:</strong> A means for the node-side behavior to access structured information based on the state of a fork of the blockchain.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary Checker:</strong> A validator who has been randomly selected to perform secondary approval checks on a parablock which is pending approval.</li>
<li><strong>Subsystem:</strong> A long-running task which is responsible for carrying out a particular category of work.</li>
<li><strong>UMP:</strong> (Upward Message Passing) A vertical message passing mechanism from a parachain to the relay chain.</li>
<li><strong>Validator:</strong> Specially-selected node in the network who is responsible for validating parachain blocks and issuing attestations about their validity.</li>
<li><strong>Validation Function:</strong> A piece of Wasm code that describes the state-transition function of a parachain.</li>
<li><strong>VMP:</strong> (Vertical Message Passing) A family of mechanisms that are responsible for message exchange between the relay chain and parachains.</li>
<li><strong>XCMP:</strong> (Cross-Chain Message Passing) A type of horizontal message passing (i.e. between parachains) that allows secure message passing directly between parachains and has minimal resource requirements from the relay chain, thus highly scalable.</li>

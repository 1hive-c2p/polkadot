//! `RemovePallet` implements `OnRuntimeUpgrade` and deletes all storage items of a given pallet.
//!
//! This can be useful for cleaning up the storage of a pallet which has been removed from the
//! runtime.
//!
//! WARNING: `RemovePallet` has no guard rails preventing it from bricking the chain if the
//! operation of removing storage for the given pallet would exceed the block weight limit.
//!
//! If your pallet has too many keys to be removed in a single block, it is advised to wait for
//! a multi-block scheduler currently under development which will allow for removal of storage
//! items (and performing other heavy migrations) over multiple blocks.
